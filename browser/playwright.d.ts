/**
 * The slice of Playwright this service uses, declared locally.
 *
 * Playwright is deliberately NOT in package.json — the same reasoning that keeps
 * `pg` out of it. A self-hosted install must not be made to download a 400MB
 * browser it will never run; only Dockerfile.browser installs it, with
 * `--no-save`, into the one image that needs it.
 *
 * But code nothing typechecks is code nobody is checking, so this declares the
 * surface actually used. If the real API drifts from this, the build that
 * matters — the browser image — is where it will show.
