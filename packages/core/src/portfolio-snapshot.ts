/**
 * THE ONE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT AN AGENT OWNS AND HOW IT IS DOING.
 *
 * It lives in core rather than in the worker, the web tier or Brain, because
 * three copies of "what is this book worth" is how you get three answers. The
 * worker computes equity from balances, the web recomputed it from mirrored
 * rows, and Brain would have been the third — and each would have been right
 * about slightly different things. The whole accounting effort behind this file
 * exists because numbers that disagree are worse than numbers that are missing.
 *
 * SO: one type, one builder, four consumers — worker, web, social, Brain.
 *
 * MONEY IS INTEGER MICRO-USDG throughout. Not a preference: the ledger stores
 * decimal REAL, the chain speaks base units, and JavaScript's number silently
 * loses the difference. A snapshot that crosses a service boundary as a float is
 * a snapshot whose last decimal place depends on who parsed it.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS TYPE REFUSES TO DO:
 *
 *   1. It will not present UNKNOWN as ZERO. `netContributionsUsdg` is null when
 *      nothing is on record, and every consumer must handle that arm — equity
 *      minus zero is the owner's own bankroll presented as profit, which is the
 *      original bug this whole system was rebuilt around.
 *   2. It will not publish a P&L it cannot back. `pnl.publishable` is computed
 *      HERE, once, from the quality object, rather than left to five different
 *      gates in the web tier that historically disagreed.
 *   3. It will not let gross-of-gas masquerade as net. The basis travels with
 *      the figure.
