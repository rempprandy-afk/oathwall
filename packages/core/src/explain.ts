/**
 * WHAT OATHWALL MEANS BY ITS OWN WORDS.
 *
 * The chat could always talk about YOUR agent — its equity, its positions, what
 * it did this morning. It could not explain what any of those words mean, so
 * every question of the form "what IS this" hit a model with no product
 * knowledge, and a model with no product knowledge does one of two things:
 * refuses, or invents something plausible about how crypto usually works. On a
 * screen where somebody has just sent real money, the second is worse.
 *
 * Testers asked, in one hour:
 *
 *   "I tried to fund my wallet with USDG but it didn't arrive"   (it had)
 *   "recovery key is only a bunch of dots"                       (by design)
 *   "couldn't read your owner key — don't fund this account"     (nothing wrong)
 *   "your wallet is on 0x… but you signed in as 0x…"             (two wallets, deliberately)
 *
 * Every one of those has a precise answer that lives in this codebase and
 * nowhere else. A general-purpose model cannot know that oathwall's `equity`
 * excludes ETH, that a balance can sit at an address with no contract deployed,
 * or that the owner key and the login wallet were never the same key. So the
 * answers are written down HERE, next to the code that makes them true, and the
 * chat is given the relevant ones rather than asked to remember.
 *
 * THREE RULES, and they are the whole design:
 *
 *  1. GROUNDED OR ABSENT. Every entry describes what this code does, cited to
 *     the file that does it. If oathwall's meaning differs from the industry
 *     meaning, the difference IS the entry — that gap is where users get hurt.
 *  2. SELECTED DETERMINISTICALLY. Which concepts reach the prompt is decided by
 *     this file, by matching words, not by a model choosing what to look up. A
 *     retrieval step that can hallucinate its own inputs is not retrieval.
 *  3. SILENCE IS AN ANSWER. A question that matches nothing returns nothing,
 *     and the prompt then tells the agent to say it does not know. The failure
 *     mode this replaces is a confident answer about a product the model has
 *     never seen.
 *
 * PURE. No I/O, no model, no chain. Handed a question, returns entries.
