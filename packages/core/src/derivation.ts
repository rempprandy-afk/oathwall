/**
 * A DERIVED ACCOUNT ADDRESS IS A RESULT, NOT A STRING.
 *
 * The counterfactual Kernel address is the single fact the hosted custody
 * boundary rests on: `web/src/app/api/grants/route.ts` proves a tenant owns the
 * account it claims by re-deriving the address from the owner and requiring the
 * two to be equal. That check is only as good as the derivation under it, and
 * the derivation has a failure mode that returns a value instead of throwing.
 *
 * WHAT GOES WRONG. `createKernelAccount` does not compute the address offline —
 * it asks the EntryPoint, via `getSenderAddress`, which is a live eth_call. When
 * that answers the zero address the SDK retries against the bare factory, and if
 * THAT also answers zero it restores `useMetaFactory` and carries on with
 * `accountAddress = 0x0000...0000`, throwing nothing
 * (@zerodev/sdk/accounts/kernel/createKernelAccount.ts:540-551). So a chain
 * whose factory is missing, an RPC that returns a malformed result, or a
 * transient node fault all produce the zero address and present as a SUCCESSFUL
 * derivation.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN AN ERROR. The route's guard is an equality test. If the
 * browser derived zero and the server also derived zero — same chain, same
 * absent factory, same fault — the two agree, `session.ts`'s own
 * plugin-does-not-move-the-address assertion passes trivially because both sides
 * are zero, and a grant is sealed for the zero address. A fail-closed 503 cannot
 * fire, because nothing failed. The check does not merely miss the fault; the
 * fault makes it pass.
 *
 * SO THE ZERO ADDRESS IS NOT AN ADDRESS HERE. `derivationOf` refuses it, along
 * with anything that is not 20 hex bytes, and `accountsMatch` refuses to compare
 * a derivation that failed. Two failures can never be "equal": there is no code
 * path on which a caller holds two `Derivation` values and gets `true` without
 * both being real addresses. That is the property, and it is enforced by the
 * types rather than by everyone remembering to check.
 *
 * PURE. No RPC, no viem, no chain. Imported by the browser signer, the hosted
 * intake, the recovery ticket and the worker.
