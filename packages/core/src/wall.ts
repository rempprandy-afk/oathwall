 * This file decides what a session key is permitted to do once the account
 * contract is enforcing it — which assets it may approve, which routers may pull
 * them, how much per call, and when the key dies. It used to live inside the
 * dashboard's session.ts, which was fine while the dashboard was the only thing
 * that could sign. It is not fine with a phone app that can sign too: two copies
 * of this list would drift, nothing would fail when they did, and the difference
 * would be a wallet with permissions its owner never agreed to.
 *
 * So it is here, imported by both, and the tests in worker/src/wall.test.ts assert
 * the exact shape rather than trusting that a refactor preserved it.
 *
 * READ BEFORE CHANGING. Every entry below is a power granted to an automated
 * agent. Widening one is not a feature flag — it is a permanent change to what a
 * compromised agent could do with someone's money, and it only takes effect for
 * grants signed afterwards, so the fleet will be running a mix of walls.

 * THE SESSION KEY MAY EXECUTE, BUT IT MAY NOT SIGN.

 * Everything else in this file is a CALL policy, and a call policy constrains

 * implements `signMessage` and `signTypedData` (@zerodev/permissions
 * toPermissionValidator), so with the library default (FOR_ALL_VALIDATION) the
 * session key can produce ERC-1271 signatures the account will honour.
 *
 * That was a hole straight through the wall, and the worst one, because it
 * bypasses the wall rather than stretching it. Permit2 is an approved spender
 * (allowedSpenders) and the stock approvals carry no amount condition, so a
 * Permit2 `permitTransferFrom` SIGNED by the session key — and submitted by
 * anyone, from their own EOA — moves tokens to any recipient with no UserOp at
 * all. No call policy is consulted, the rate limit never fires, and nothing in
 * the ledger records it. The same shape covers EIP-2612 permits and any
 * off-chain order that settles against an ERC-1271 signature.
 *
 * NOT_FOR_VALIDATE_SIG closes it: the kernel refuses to validate signatures
 * from this permission, while UserOp execution is untouched. This costs
 * merrymen nothing — the entire trading path is UserOps, and the v4 route
 * authorises Permit2 with a CALL (`permit2.approve`, see venues/uniswap-v4.ts)
 * rather than a signed permit. Grep confirms nothing in worker/, packages/ or
 * web/src/lib signs with the session account.
 *
 * The flag travels ON-CHAIN in the validator's enable data, so the account
 * itself enforces it — this is not a client-side promise. It is also hashed
 * into the permission id, which means it only takes effect for grants signed
 * AFTER this change: existing grants keep the old, permissive wall until
 * they're re-signed. See the header note about the fleet running a mix.

    // which was true only while its single-hop sibling was equally open. Now
    // that `exactInputSingle` pins both token legs, this permission is the
    // loosest door in the wall: the output token lives inside a packed `path`
    // and can be anything at all.
    //
    // AND THE PATH CANNOT BE CONSTRAINED. `SLICE_EQUAL` is the only condition
    // in the library aimed at dynamic bytes, and it is unavailable twice over:
    // it requires CallPolicyVersion V0_0_5 while this wall pins V0_0_4, and
    // even there it resolves the argument type from the ABI, where
    // ExactInputParams is a `tuple` and never a `bytes`. A fixed-offset rule
    // cannot help either — the path is `token(20) ‖ fee(3) ‖ token(20) …`, so
    // the output token straddles two words and its word index MOVES with the
    // hop count. There is no word that equals a token address.
    //
    // WHAT THIS COSTS, said plainly: roughly three quarters of this chain's
    // pools quote against WETH, so any token with no direct USDG pair becomes
    // unreachable. That is a real loss of reach and it is the honest trade —
    // the alternative is shipping a hole that cannot be closed. The way back is
    // an adapter with static args (V4SelfSwap is the pattern), not this.
    // ── the V4SelfSwap adapter, when the owner opted in ──────────────────
    //
    // ONE permission, and STRICTER than the v3 routes above it. `swapExactIn`
    // has eight all-static arguments, so each maps to its own calldata word
    // and each is individually pinnable — proven against viem's encoder in
    // wall.test.ts, the same way the two routes above are.
    //
    // tokenIn and tokenOut are pinned ONE_OF over the same asset set the
    // approve targets derive from — USDG plus every token this signature can
    // approve for a sell. Computed inside this same call from the same
    // `extras`, so the two lists cannot drift within one grant. That closes
    // the attack the v3 routes still accept: a stolen session key minting a
    // worthless token and swapping the whole approved balance into it costs
    // the attacker only gas. Here, both legs must be assets the OWNER named.
    // The cost of that strictness is zero, not small: a new token needs a
    // re-sign to be SELLABLE anyway (the no-exit rule), so being pinned here
    // adds no friction that does not already exist.
    //
    // The words left null are null for stated reasons. amountIn (word 5) is
    // denominated in tokenIn's own units — a USDG-derived cap would be
    // meaningless on a sell — and the approve caps above are the real bound:
    // the adapter can only pull what was approved, and pulls are further
    // bounded by its own PullExceedsAmountIn check. minAmountOut (word 6) is
    // denominated in the OUTPUT token, so no single figure means anything
    // across pairs; the adapter's NoOutput guard is what stops a null here
    // meaning "zero is acceptable". hooks (word 4) is null DELIBERATELY:
    // hooked pools are the entire point (new pairs launch through them), and
    // a hostile hook is inside the adapter's tested threat model — it can
    // worsen a price, never redirect the output or overdraw the pull.
    //
    // And the word that is not here at all is the reason this contract
    // exists: there is no recipient argument. It is msg.sender, in bytecode.
