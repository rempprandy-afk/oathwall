/**
 * $MERRYMEN — the token, and the "Merry Circle" holder-utility layer.
 *
 * STANCE (do not drift): utility only. Nothing here — or in any copy that renders
 * these tiers — promises price, returns, buybacks, or burns. Holding earns you
 * ACCESS and a lower platform fee, full stop. merrymen itself stays free, open,
 * and self-hosted whether you hold or not; the token buys perks, never the product.
 *
 * The one material perk is a discount on the platform PERFORMANCE fee (the fee is
 * only ever taken on profit above the high-water mark; see worker/src/fees.ts).
 * Everything else is identity (a tier + badge), agency (governance weight), and a
 * bonus strategy pack. Tiers are read from an on-chain balanceOf — verifiable,
 * not claimed.
 *
 * Thresholds below are the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH and are meant to be tuned; they
 * are round placeholders, not calibrated to any supply or price.
 */

/**
 * Where the Merry Circle gateway actually lives — the ONE place this is written.
 *
 * The gateway is the holder-utility layer in practice: it fronts the LLM and
 * Bitquery so a holder needs no keys of their own. Its hostname was previously
 * duplicated across the provider registry, the CLI's provider table and the
 * Bitquery client, which meant moving it was four edits and a test, and missing
 * one left some paths pointing at a host that wasn't serving.
 *
 * CURRENTLY the Railway service URL. `ai.merrymen.dev` is registered and its DNS
 * is correct, but Railway hasn't issued the Let's Encrypt certificate yet, so
 * TLS on that name resets. Both hostnames route to the same service — switch
 * this line back once the cert lands and every path follows.
