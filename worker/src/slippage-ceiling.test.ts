/**
 * THE CEILING IS A PRODUCT POLICY, AND IT HAS TO LIVE IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * It was 5,000 bps — a minOut of half the trade — written as a literal in a web
 * route's validation table and again in the worker's resolver, where an
 * out-of-range value SILENTLY fell back to the default rather than being
 * refused. Two enforcement points for a rule that was never written down, and a
 * third check (`minOutWithSlippage`) twice as permissive again because its job
 * is only to stop a negative minOut.
 *
 * These tests are about the seams rather than the number: a ceiling that lives
 * in three literals is one careless edit from being three different ceilings.
