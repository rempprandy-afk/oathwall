/**
 * The store side of reading deposits off the chain.
 *
 * `findTransferFlows` is pure and tested without a chain; these three helpers
 * are the part that touches the ledger, and between them they are what stops a
 * deposit being counted twice.
 *
 * WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN IT SOUNDS. The scan deliberately re-reads its last
 * block on every pass — a block can carry several transfers, and a crash between
 * two of them would otherwise strand the rest permanently. So the same log IS
 * seen again, every tick, by design. `knownFlowKeys` is the only thing standing
 * between that and a contribution booked twice, and contributions are what P&L
 * is measured against: double one and the account reports a loss it never took.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(); node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
