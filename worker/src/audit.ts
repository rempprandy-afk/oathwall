/**
 * The audit format, and the verifier for it.
 *
 * The premise: someone who does not trust the operator, has never installed
 * merrymen, and has only a public RPC should be able to check every performance
 * claim the software makes. Until this existed they could not — the ledger is a
 * plain sqlite file on the operator's own disk, the equity curve is a series of
 * balance readings written by the process being audited, and nothing
 * cross-checked any of it.
 *
 * Three independent things are checked, and they fail differently on purpose:
 *
 *   1. THE CHAIN. Each record carries the hash of the one before it, so an
 *      edited record breaks every hash after it, and `seq` is monotonic, so a
 *      DELETED record shows up as a gap. Silence is as detectable as tampering.
 *
 *   2. THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY. Every fill and every flow names a transaction. A
 *      verifier with an RPC refetches it and compares the token movements the
 *      record claims against the ones the chain actually recorded. This is the
 *      part that makes the record more than internally consistent.
 *
 *   3. THE ARITHMETIC. Equity is recomputed from primitives — fills, flows and
 *      marks — rather than read back, and compared against what was published.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and takes its inputs as data, so the verifier can run
 * against a file it did not produce, with no access to ~/.merrymen.
