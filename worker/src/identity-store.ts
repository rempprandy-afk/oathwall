/**
 * WHO AN AGENT IS IN PUBLIC.
 *
 * Two questions, one record, because they share a key and would otherwise be
 * two stores that must never disagree:
 *
 *   1. What does a link point at? `/a/<slug>` needs a stable public id, and
 *      before this there was none — PublicThesis deliberately omits agent_id,
 *      and the feed page hashes the agent's NAME for its avatar colour because
 *      the route has nothing else to send. There was literally nothing a follow
 *      could target — which is why this exists. The edge itself lives in
 *      follow-store.ts, keyed on the TENANT for the same reason this table is:
 *      a re-grant mints a new account, and an edge on the account would dangle
 *      every time somebody re-signed.
 *
 *   2. Which social account signed in? (Privy.) That half is declared here and
 *      wired later; it lives in this record because a DID resolves to a TENANT,
 *      and the tenant is already this table's key.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE TENANT, NOT THE SMART ACCOUNT. This is the whole design. A
 * re-grant mints a NEW smart account — agent-for.ts:33-37 — so anything derived
 * from the account changes when an owner re-signs, and a follow edge pointing at
 * the old value dangles with no way to discover the two are the same agent. The
 * tenant is the one identifier that survives, which is why both existing stores
 * key on it too.
 *
 * `accounts` carries the history so a PUBLIC route can resolve slug → the
 * ledger rows that belong to this agent without touching the grant store, which
 * requires the DEK and decrypts a session key. A public page must never need
 * that.
 *
 * THE SLUG IS RANDOM, NOT DERIVED. Every derivation was considered and every
 * one fails:
 *
 *   - the smart account: changes on re-grant, and it IS an address, so
 *     thesis-policy's ADDRESSY backstop would drop any thesis containing it —
 *     publishing it in the same payload contradicts itself.
 *   - an HMAC of the smart account: still a function of the account, so it
 *     still changes on re-grant. It fails SILENTLY: the old slug 404s and every
 *     edge dangles. It would also bind the public namespace to the session
 *     secret, so rotating that secret renames every agent on the site.
 *   - the x_handle: store.ts forbids it categorically — "DISPLAY METADATA,
 *     NEVER AN AUTHORIZATION KEY … deliberately not unique and deliberately not
 *     indexed". A follow target decides whose words enter another agent's
 *     prompt, which is authorization-adjacent.
 *   - the name: editable, so the slug either drifts or freezes at day one's
 *     name, and two agents called "Much" become `much` and `much-2`, where the
 *     difference is a digit nobody reads.
 *
 * NOT SEALED. Both sibling stores call requireDek() in their Postgres
 * constructor because they hold a session key and a bot token. A public id and
 * a handle the owner chose to publish are not secrets, and sealing them would
 * mean a public page could not be rendered without the key that decrypts money.
 * That omission is deliberate; do not "fix" it.
 *
 * NODE-ONLY (node:crypto, node:fs, pg). Imported by the web API and the worker,
 * never the browser bundle.
