 * needs to sweep funds out of the smart account. Deleting it without a copy
 * strands the funds permanently.
 *
 * The CLI (`archiveCurrentGrant` in cli/bin.mjs) and the web `DELETE

 * reachable from Telegram — did not, because the worker package had no archive
 * path at all. This is that function, on this side of the fence.

 * to keep. Never throws: a kill switch must fire even if the disk is full.
