/**
 * WHAT THE POOL CHARGES YOU FOR YOUR OWN SIZE.
 *
 * A quote that exists is not a quote worth taking. Until this existed, the only
 * thing between a $5,000 order and a $4,000 pool was `minOut` — and minOut is
 * derived FROM the quote, so a fill forty percent through the book got a floor
 * one percent below its own forty percent and executed happily. minOut defends
 * against the price moving between the quote and the fill. Nothing defended
 * against the quote itself.
 *
 * The header of venues/uniswap.ts claimed a terrible quote "is skipped by the
 * impact guard upstream". There was no such guard, anywhere in the repo. This
 * is it, and that comment now points here.
 *
 * MEASURED FROM TWO QUOTES ON THE SAME ROUTE, not from the depth map.
 * venues/depth.ts can compute this exactly — its own header says its ladder
 * reproduces QuoterV2 to 0.0000% — but the depth read is up to five minutes
 * old, covers ONE pool where the router fills across several tiers, is
 * quantised to a 50bps band, and is simply absent for every token with no
 * direct USDG pair, which is most of the memecoins this guard exists for.
 * The quoter is fresh, whole-route, exact, and already being called. Given two
 * methods that agree to 0.0000%, take the one that is about to execute.
 *
 * That choice also keeps this clear of the propose/dispose line that
 * venues/depth.invariant.test.ts pins. This module consumes no depth data and
 * adds no input to checkPolicy. Its inputs are two QuoterV2 answers about the
 * identical route this trade is about to take. The invariant's fear is an
 * attacker flooding a pool so the agent SIZES UP; here, adding liquidity can
 * only lower measured impact toward passing — toward the fill the agent would
 * have got anyway. This guard can only ever refuse. It can never permit more.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC. Impact is how much worse the AVERAGE execution price of this
 * size is than the MARGINAL price of the same route:
 *
 *   impactBps = 10_000 − (amountOut × probeIn × 10_000) / (probeOut × amountIn)
 *
 * Both quotes pay the same proportional pool fee, so the FEE CANCELS and what
 * is left is impact alone. That is why the default does not have to be inflated
 * to absorb a 1% fee tier, and why the same threshold means the same thing on a
 * 5bps pool and a 10000bps one.
 *
 * KNOWN BIAS, stated rather than buried: the probe sits at 1% of the order
 * rather than at zero, so this measures (dx − probe)/(x + dx) where the true
 * figure is dx/(x + dx) — an understatement of about 1%. Checked against
 * closed-form constant-product math in impact.test.ts. At a 300bps cap the
 * guard really admits up to ~303bps. Probing smaller would close the gap and
 * lose more to integer rounding on a 6dp token, which is the worse trade.
 *
 * An oracle comparison (quote vs. lastPrices) was considered and rejected: it
 * conflates the pool's persistent premium or discount to Chainlink with impact,
 * and it is unavailable for exactly the unpriceable scout tokens that need this
 * most. QuoterV2's `sqrtPriceX96After` was considered too: it measures the END
 * price move rather than average execution cost, and does not compose across a
 * multi-hop path or v4. The two-quote ratio composes uniformly across v3
 * single-hop, v3 multi-hop and v4.

 * exponents rather than just correcting them. At 18 decimals that same constant
 * is 10^-14 of a dollar — so the floor still EXISTED, still had a comment
 * claiming it was a cent, and floored nothing at all.
 *
 * The failure it would have caused is worth naming: `probeAmountIn` returns
 * null when an order is too small to measure honestly, and a null probe is what
 * makes an unmeasured trade report unmeasured instead of reporting zero impact.
 * With the floor at 10^-14, that branch became unreachable, and every dust
 * order would have been probed with a quantity so small the quote is pure
