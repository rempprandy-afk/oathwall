/**
 * THE ONLY DEFINITION OF PAPER.
 *
 * There were two. `paperActive()` decided what the tick VALUED and what the
 * heartbeat REPORTED; a separate `if (!executor)` decided what the execution
 * fork actually DID. They were written at different times to answer the same
 * question, and they disagreed for every hosted tenant — because the
 * orchestrator deliberately forwards the house bundler key to every child, so
 * `executor` is never null there and the fork's paper arm was dead code.
 *
 * The fleet was therefore labelled paper, valued paper — the paper tick zeroes
 * the ETH balance — and executed live, against a gas pre-flight reading a
 * balance the paper tick had fabricated. Every intent died on `no-gas`, and not
 * one simulated fill was ever booked. `paper-mode.test.ts` was written to
 * prevent exactly this, and could not: it pinned the DEFINITION site with four
 * source regexes, and the bug was at the USE site.
 *
 * So the rule lives here, in a pure function with a seam, and both callers ask
 * it. A predicate that decides whether real money moves should be readable in
 * one screen and testable without a chain.
 *
 * TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION. The return type has no fourth state, and the branches
 * below partition the input exactly. The old fork had a fourth state and nobody
 * noticed: with paper trading OFF, a wrong-chain or read-as-broke agent fell
 * straight through to the live rail and built a swap against a dead chain.
 * Nothing prevented that; `paper-mode.test.ts:76-80` only asserted such an
 * agent was not PAPER, never that it did not TRADE.
