/**
 * WHAT BRAIN IS ALLOWED TO KNOW, AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES.
 *
 * The first production shadow decisions all said the same thing:
 *
 *   "All analyst lenses report no data for TSLA; the only price point is stale
 *    and unreliable. With no recent market, news, sentiment or fundamentals,
 *    there is no actionable evidence to take a position."
 *
 * That is the correct answer to the question it was asked, and it means the
 * evaluation was measuring the wrong thing: whether Brain refuses to invent,
 * rather than whether Brain reasons. It refuses to invent. Now give it
 * something to reason about.
 *
 * THE RULE IS UNCHANGED — a lens with nothing gets NOTHING, never a plausible
 * sentence. `news` and `fundamentals` stay absent because the worker has no
 * honest source for either on this chain, and an omitted lens makes Brain
 * answer NO DATA AVAILABLE, which is true. What this module adds is the
 * material the worker genuinely holds and was simply not sending.
 *
 * MEMORY ARRIVES ALREADY THROUGH THE PUBLICATION GATE, and that is the
 * load-bearing decision here. The raw `decisions` table is not safe text: a
 * `chat`-sourced row embeds a raw counterparty address by template, on every
 * chat transfer, and `dropped_rule` is a template with a model-supplied hole in
 * it. Feeding either straight into a prompt would put an owner's counterparties
 * into a model's context and then into `signals_json`, where the next prompt
 * reads them back.
 *
 * So the rule is: AN AGENT MAY REMEMBER WHAT IT COULD HAVE SAID IN PUBLIC.
 * The orchestrator materialises exactly that — the same `publishableThesis`
 * output the feed publishes, with its source allowlist, its 220-character cap
 * on model prose, its address backstop and its fail-closed default — into the
 * child's peer file. This module renders it and adds nothing, so memory cannot
 * drift from publication, and a new decision source stays unreadable by Brain
 * until somebody classifies it. That is the correct default for a field which,
 * if it is ever wrong, is wrong permanently.
 *
 * Everything here is bounded on length as well as on source, because this text
 * is billed by the token on every analyst call, and prompt size is the real
 * cost driver — not call count.
