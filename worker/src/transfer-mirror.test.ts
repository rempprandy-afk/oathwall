/**
 * THE MIRROR MAY NEVER BE LOOSER THAN THE CHAIN.
 *
 * packages/core/src/wall.ts emits a USDG `transfer` permission only for
 * withdrawal addresses registered at signing, and NEITHER signer registers any
 * — so no grant this repo can mint carries one. Both signers nonetheless wrote
 * the literal string "transfer" into grantFeatures, and limits.ts never set
 * `withdrawalAddresses` at all, which policy.ts reads as "pre-allowlist grant,
 * still free-form" and permits.
 *
 * So the worker believed it could send, built the UserOp, and the account
 * contract refused it: gas spent to be told no, with a revert reason that
 * explains nothing. Exactly the failure family as quoting a multi-hop route the
 * key could not execute — a mirror describing intent rather than the policy.
 *
 * These tests assert the two halves against each other, not against prose.
