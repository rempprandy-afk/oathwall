/**
 * WHAT REACHES A PROMPT, AND WHAT MUST NOT.
 *
 * Two different failures live in this module and they pull in opposite
 * directions. Send too little and Brain answers "no data" forever, which is
 * what production actually did — every early shadow decision was a hold
 * justified by the absence of any input at all. Send too much, or send the
 * wrong thing, and an owner's counterparty address ends up in a model's context
 * and then in `signals_json`, where the next prompt reads it back.
 *
 * The resolution is that this module RENDERS and never SOURCES: everything it
 * is given has already been through `publishableThesis`, and these tests pin
 * that it does not reach around that.
