/**
 * `merrymen selftest` IS THE GATE BEFORE REAL MONEY.
 *
 * cli/bin.mjs walks a first-timer to it as onboarding step 4, "prove the shot
 * lands". Three separate things made it prove nothing:
 *
 *  1. It exited 0 unconditionally. processIntent absorbs every failure — a
 *     policy rejection, no-route, no-gas, a bundler refusal, an on-chain revert
 *     all record a row and return normally — so "did not throw" carries no
 *     information whatsoever. It printed "done" for UserOps the wall refused.
 *  2. The approve leg was hardcoded to the Rialto router, so a green result
 *     said nothing about the default Uniswap path. Worse — see the test below —
 *     Rialto is not in the wall of any grant this repo can sign, so the probe
 *     violated the call policy on every install, and reported success.
 *  3. It passed equityUsdg = 0n with equityKnown defaulting to true: an
 *     unknown book asserted as a zero one, in a codebase whose central rule is
 *     that unknown is never representable as zero.
 *
 * index.ts exports nothing, so the wiring is pinned as source. The claim about
 * the WALL below is checked for real, against the real permission builder.
