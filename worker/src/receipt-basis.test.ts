/**
 * The round trip that could not book P&L.
 *
 * A live buy booked its quantity from `minOut` — the slippage FLOOR — while
 * paying the full cash amount. The comment defending it was right that a fill
 * can come in worse than quoted but never better, so the bound is conservative
 * on PRICE. The consequence it missed: the tracked quantity ends up about
 * slippageBps BELOW the balance actually sitting on-chain.
 *
 * Every full exit sells `held.rawBalance`, the real balance. That exceeds the
 * tracked basis, so applyFill flags partlyUnbacked, returns zero realized, and
 * the row is written with realized_pnl_usdg NULL — excluded from every sum.
 * So a live round trip could not produce a realized figure AT ALL, and the
 * warning blamed a position that "predates basis tracking".
 *
 * These tests run the two booking strategies through the REAL basis engine and
 * show the difference, so the fix cannot be quietly reverted.
