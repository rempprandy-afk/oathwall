/**
 * Quarantine — holding something you cannot price, without lying about it.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. oathwall refuses to value a token whose pool is too new or too
 * thin, because that price can be pushed by anyone with moderate capital and it
 * feeds equity, P&L and the drawdown breaker. That refusal is correct. But it
 * left a hole: the moment ONE such token was held, the tick stopped publishing
 * equity at all — no high-water mark, no fee accrual, no breaker — for the whole
 * book, including the deep, Chainlink-priced majority of it. One unpriceable
 * dust position blinded every safety mechanism the owner was relying on.
 *
 * THE FIX. Carry an unpriceable position at what it COST.
 *
 * Cost is a historical fact. Nobody can push it, no pool can move it, and it
 * needs no oracle. It is emphatically NOT a market price and is never presented
 * as one — but it keeps the equity arithmetic sound so the breaker can keep
 * judging the rest of the book, which is the part it can actually protect.
 *
 * THE LIMIT, STATED PLAINLY. A position carried at cost does not move. If it
 * goes to zero, equity will not show it and the drawdown breaker will not fire.
 * That is not an oversight — it is the unavoidable consequence of refusing to
 * trust the only price available. The scout BUDGET is therefore the real risk
 * control for this money, not the breaker. Every surface that shows a
 * quarantined value has to say "at cost" so nobody reads it as a valuation.
