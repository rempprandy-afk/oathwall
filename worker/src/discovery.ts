/**
 * Discovery — telling the owner a pair exists, and nothing more than that.
 *
 * merrymen reads Uniswap v3 pools directly and can compute a v4 PoolKey when the
 * pool is vanilla. Neither of those finds a HOOKED pool: Pons/Doppler launches
 * attach a hook whose address can't be guessed, so the pool is unreachable by
 * any amount of scanning. Bitquery decodes this chain's Initialize events from
 * genesis, which is the only way those become visible at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS EXPLICITLY NOT. It does not add tokens, widen a cap, or produce a
 * trade. This module only ever REPORTS and records what it found.
 *
 * The `trencher` strategy can act on those records — but only when the owner has
 * selected it, and in live mode only for a token they added and re-signed the
 * grant to cover. So the sequence stays owner → wall → agent, never feed →
 * agent. Nothing here is on the dispose side, and it must stay that way: a
 * discovery feed that could open positions BY ITSELF would be a feed that
 * decides what to buy, which is the one thing the permission model exists to
 * prevent. Recording a candidate is not deciding to hold it.
 *
 * It also runs on its OWN slow cadence, not the trading tick. The holder gateway
 * allows a handful of calls a minute across everything a wallet does, and a
 * poll that starved the brain of its allowance would trade one feature for
 * another the owner is more likely to be relying on.
