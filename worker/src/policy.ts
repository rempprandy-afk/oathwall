/**
 * Deterministic policy layer — and its posture DEPENDS ON THE RAIL, which is
 * the single most important thing to understand about this file.
 *
 * ON THE EVM RAIL (swap / vault / transfer) it is a MIRROR of the on-chain
 * Kernel session-key policies: the on-chain caps are the hard wall; this layer
 * exists to reject bad intents cheaply and log WHY, before gas is spent. If
 * this code and the on-chain policy ever disagree, the on-chain policy wins
 * and that divergence is a bug to alert on. A mirror must never be stricter
 * than the chain — a stricter mirror rejects trades the wall would allow.
 *
 * ON THE BROKER RAIL (equity-order) there is NO on-chain policy to mirror.
 * Robinhood's Agentic account is custodial, its OAuth scope cannot be
 * restricted below full trading, and nothing re-checks amounts after this
 * function returns ok — so here this layer IS the wall, and the posture
 * inverts: deliberately conservative, because there is no backstop to defer
 * to. The only enforcement beneath it is Robinhood's own account-level
 * reserved budget. This is why processIntent runs checkPolicy TWICE on that
 * rail — once on the proposed notional and again on the terms review()
 * returns — where the EVM rail relies on the account contract for the
 * re-check. (spikes/robinhood-mcp/DESIGN.md §5.)
 *
 * Nothing in this file may call an LLM, read agent memory, or take a string that
 * originated from a model. Intents come in typed; verdicts go out typed.
