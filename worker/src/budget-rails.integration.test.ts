/**
 * The daily budget is TWO books, proven against a real sqlite file (a throwaway
 * MERRYMEN_HOME) — same discipline as the decisions and brokerage tests.
 *
 * These exist because of a real incident. On 2026-07-15 a paper run spent the
 * LIVE 48-op allowance: getOpsToday counted status IN ('landed','paper',
 * 'submitted'), so 48 simulated fills exhausted the cap in 21 minutes and the
 * remaining 11.7 hours of the run are 1,242 identical 'ops-cap' rejections.
 * A unit test could not have caught it — the bug was in a SQL status list.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(); node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
