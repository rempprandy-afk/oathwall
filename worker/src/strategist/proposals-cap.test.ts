/**
 * THE STRATEGIST HAS TO SIZE TO THE WALL IT IS BEHIND.
 *
 * A new agent is minted with `perTradeUsdg: 10` sealed into its SIGNATURE
 * (web/src/terminal/screens/CreateAgent.tsx), while `llmMaxActionUsdg` defaults
 * to 50 (packages/core/src/settings.ts). The strategist was told the settings
 * number, proposed the settings number, and every action it produced died at
 * `per-trade-cap` — on every agent minted with the default preset, on every
 * window, for the life of the grant.
 *
 * Nothing in Settings could fix it. The cap comes from the signature
 * (`limitsFromGrant`), so an owner reading "trading limits are set and lower
 * than the USDG amount" was correct and still blocked. One of them reported it
 * exactly that way.
 *
 * The fix is `min(setting, snapshot cap)`, folded in above the driver call. It
 * can only ever TIGHTEN — it cannot raise what anybody may spend, and it needs
 * no re-signing, so it repairs every already-signed agent at once. The two
 * alternatives were both wrong: raising the minted preset seals a bigger number
 * into every future grant, and lowering the setting silently shrinks every
 * owner who signed a larger one.
 *
 * The same hoist is what makes a curve leg reachable at all — see the note in
 * strategy.ts — so these tests also pin the ordering that made it inert.
