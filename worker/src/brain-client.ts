/**
 * TALKING TO BRAIN, over the private network, with no way to be talked back into
 * anything dangerous.
 *
 * Mirrors research.ts and the browser client point for point, because those
 * exist for the identical reason and their shape is already load-bearing here:
 * a typed `{ok: …}` union rather than exceptions crossing the wire, an
 * AbortController set ABOVE the server's own timeout, a bounded read, and NO
 * RETRIES.
 *
 * The no-retry rule is the one worth restating. A Brain run costs real tokens
 * and takes tens of seconds; a client that retries a timeout has not recovered
 * anything, it has bought the same decision twice and doubled the bill. If Brain
 * did not answer, the trigger that woke it will fire again on its own schedule.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLIENT WILL NOT DO, and the service could not make it:
 *   - resolve a symbol to an address (that is the trusted TS adapter's job, and
 *     it is deliberately not called from here);
 *   - construct calldata or a target;
 *   - hand Brain a session key, an owner key, a bundler key or DATABASE_URL.
 *
 * The decision that comes back is DATA. It is persisted and it may be published
 * as a thesis. It does not reach proposalsToIntents, checkPolicy or the executor
 * — there is no code path from here to any of them, and that absence is the
 * shadow-mode guarantee rather than a flag someone could flip.
