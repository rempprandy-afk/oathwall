 * it here turns a new PERMANENT failure into a retryable one — and this file
 * treats `unclassified` as retryable on purpose. That is how a single refused
 * trade becomes 1,242 identical rejections, one per tick, for the life of the

 *
 * The other rule worth keeping: Pons's OWN reverts were left unclassified
 * deliberately. A scoping pass reported its SlippageExceeded as 0x71c4efed
 * while deriving the signature gave 0x8199f5f3; the two disagreed, so neither
 * was evidence, and nothing was added from memory. Retryable-and-visible beats
 * confidently-wrong.
