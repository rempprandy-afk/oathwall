/**
 * An epoch boundary must not republish the bankroll as profit.
 *
 * The epoch mechanism exists to quarantine rows written before the accounting
 * was fixed. But equity is an ABSOLUTE balance reading while flows are
 * EPOCH-SCOPED, so bumping the epoch without carrying the capital over stops
 * the two terms living in the same frame: the new epoch's contributions start
 * at nothing while equity still holds every dollar deposited before the
 * boundary.
 *
 * The COUNT(*) guard hides that only while there are ZERO flows. The first
 * top-up in the new epoch makes contributions equal to just that top-up, and
 * `equity − contributions` publishes the entire bankroll as profit — which is
 * the precise bug the epoch boundary was built to end, reintroduced by the
 * boundary itself.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(); node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
