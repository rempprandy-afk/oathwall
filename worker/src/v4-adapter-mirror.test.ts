/**
 * THE ADAPTER MIRROR — both halves asserted against each other, the
 * transfer-mirror idiom.
 *
 * The rule runs in both directions and this file holds both. LOOSER than the
 * chain (the transfer saga): a mirror that admits a target the wall refuses
 * makes the worker build UserOps the account contract rejects — gas spent to
 * be told no. STRICTER than the chain (the multihop bug's silent sibling): a
 * mirror missing a target the wall grants kills a correctly-signed route
 * off-chain at `target-allowlist`, and nothing ever fires — a route that
 * looks granted and silently is not.
 *
 * The load-bearing choice under test: limits mirror the GRANT-SEALED address
 * via grantV4Adapter (marker AND address), never settings. Settings feed the
 * signers; the grant is the record of what was actually signed.
