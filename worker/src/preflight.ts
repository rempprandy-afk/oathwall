/**
 * Is this install actually able to make a real trade?
 *
 * `merrymen doctor` answers "is the software installed and configured" — node,
 * npm, PATH, keys present, RPCs reachable, the grant not expired. It is good at
 * that and says nothing about the thing an owner is about to bet money on:
 * whether the account can trade at all.
 *
 * Of the conditions that must hold for one live trade, doctor checks none of
 * the following: the account's USDG, the account's ETH (the only one that
 * guarantees failure), whether the grant's CHAIN can trade, whether the
 * signature can sell what the basket buys, whether the trade size is above the
 * point where gas stops dominating, or whether a bundler API key actually
 * answers — its probe only runs for a hand-pasted full URL, so the common path
 * is never contacted.
 *
 * This is that check. It JUDGES rather than reports: a testnet grant is a
 * blocker, not a green line with an interesting number in it.
 *
 * Pure, and takes everything as data, so it is testable without a chain — the
 * CLI gathers, this decides.
