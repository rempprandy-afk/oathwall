/**
 * IS THE MIGRATION SAFE AGAINST THE ROWS THAT ARE ACTUALLY THERE?
 *
 * The repair's whole idempotency guarantee rests on one partial unique index,
 * and that index is created by a DDL statement inside a try/catch that swallows
 * errors — a catch that exists for a good reason (re-running an ALTER must be a
 * no-op) and which means a FAILED index creation is indistinguishable from a
 * successful one at every later call site. So "the index is there" is not
 * something to assume. It is something to test against the data.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY THERE. The hosted `flows` table holds 363 rows, every one of
 * them `inferred` with a NULL transaction and a NULL log index. None of them can
 * conflict with the new index, and it is worth being exact about WHY, because an
 * earlier version of this comment got it wrong in a way that would have let a
 * reviewer approve the migration for a reason that does not exist.
 *
 * They cannot conflict because NULLs are DISTINCT in a unique index on both
 * SQLite and Postgres. That is true with or without the predicate — so for these
 * 363 rows `WHERE tx_hash IS NOT NULL AND log_index IS NOT NULL` changes
 * nothing, and the earlier claim that a non-partial index would "collapse them
 * and delete the history" was false. An index does not delete rows; it either
 * builds or fails to build.
 *
 * The predicate is a statement of intent and an index-size saving, not a shield.
 * The tests below check what is actually true: that the index is created, and
 * that every legacy row survives it.
 *
 * The dangerous case is not the 363. It is a PAIR of rows naming the same log in
 * different hash cases, which the normalisation would turn into a genuine
 * duplicate and which would then make the CREATE fail — silently. That case is
 * constructed below, and what the repair does about it is the point of the last
 * test: it refuses to run.
