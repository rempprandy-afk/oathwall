 *
 * Kernel v3 packs the answer into the nonce. The 32-byte nonce is
 * `key(24) ‖ seq(8)`, and the key is `mode(1) ‖ vType(1) ‖ identifier(20) ‖ id(2)`
 * — so the top two bytes of the nonce are the mode and the validator type.
 * @zerodev/sdk sets VALIDATOR_MODE.ENABLE (0x01) exactly when the regular
 * validator is not yet enabled ON CHAIN, and VALIDATOR_TYPE.PERMISSION is 0x02.
 *
 * Measured on 4663, 2026-09-03:
 *   sudo-only account   0x0000845adb2c…  mode 0x00 (DEFAULT)  -> not an enable
 *   walled account      0x0102630974640…  mode 0x01, type 0x02 -> IS an enable
 *
 * Both bytes are required. Mode alone would also admit an enable of some other
 * validator type, which is not the operation this ceiling was measured for.
 *
 * NECESSARY, NOT SUFFICIENT. This says the operation is SHAPED like an enable.
 * It does not say the enable is one anybody needs — the SDK computes this mode
 * from a read that fails toward ENABLE, so a single flaky eth_call can produce
 * this shape for an operation whose validator is already installed. readEnableState

 * WHY THIS OPERATION IS EXPENSIVE, OR WHY WE WILL NOT ASSUME IT IS.
 *
 * The elevated ceiling exists for one operation: the one that installs a session
 * key's whole policy wall inside validation. Getting the gate wrong in either
 * direction is expensive, and both directions have now been measured.
 *
 * TOO NARROW WAS THE FIRST BUG. This condition was `!accountLive && isFirstEnable(nonce)`,
 * on the belief that a validator enable is one-time per ACCOUNT. It is one-time
 * per SESSION KEY. Measured on 4663, 2026-09-03, on two real deployed accounts
 * and a third synthesised one, a renewal on an account that already has code
 * costs 7,401,680 / 7,530,220 / 7,569,825 raw — 96-98% of the undeployed first
 * op's 7,711,654. Deployment is worth 141,823-309,974 gas, a rounding error
 * against the enable. Every one-click renewal would have been refused.
 *
 * TOO WIDE IS THE HAZARD THE FIX INTRODUCES, and this function is why it does
 * not. @zerodev's isPluginEnabled catches EVERY read error to `false` (both
 * disjuncts do), so one flaky eth_call makes the SDK build an ENABLE-shaped
 * operation for a validator that is already installed. Measured by fault
 * injection: healthy read -> mode 0x00, one broken read -> mode 0x01, same
 * account, same id. On the nonce alone that operation would have been handed
 * 12,000,000 for work nobody needs.
 *
 * So the shape is checked against the chain, and the chain is asked about the
 * exact id the operation names. Three things must all hold:
 *
 *   1. the nonce is enable-shaped                        (isFirstEnable)
 *   2. its sequence is 0, so this enable has never been INCLUDED. The EntryPoint
 *      increments only on inclusion, so a rejected or retried enable stays at 0
 *      while a landed one is 1 forever. Measured: a landed enable key reads 1
 *      and its account's traffic has moved to the default key; an id that never
 *      landed reads 0. Nothing in this process can choose these bytes.
 *   3. permissionConfig(id) on the account is empty. Measured to be keyed by
 *      (account, id): the same id reads INSTALLED on one live account and absent
 *      on another, and a codeless address answers with empty returndata rather
 *      than zeros.
 *
 * AND IT FAILS CLOSED, which INVERTS the rule isDeployed uses twenty lines up.
 * There, a failed read answers "not deployed" because being wrong that way only
 * widened a ceiling. Here "no code" is a reason to widen, so a read we could not
 * make must never be allowed to manufacture one. Unreadable is its own answer
 * and it refuses. A refusal costs nothing and the next tick retries; a wrongly
 * widened ceiling is a safety check that turned itself off.
