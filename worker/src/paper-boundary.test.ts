/**
 * THE SHAPES PRODUCTION ACTUALLY PRODUCED, pinned so they cannot come back.
 *
 * These are not invented cases. Every fixture below is a row shape read out of
 * the hosted ledger during the diagnosis, and each one is a different way a
 * simulated balance became a claim about an owner's money:
 *
 *   out 1000, repeated        a paper book reset and re-run
 *   out 500, repeated         the same, at the other configured size
 *   out 58.335 / 41.670 /     paper FILLS. `reconcileFlows` books a cash change
 *      25.005 / 8.340         no ledger row explains — a rule written for a real
 *                             account, where only the owner can do that
 *
 * and the three account shapes the repair has to tell apart:
 *
 *   a paper account with zero chain history  → contributed exactly nothing
 *   a funded live account                    → contributed what the chain says
 *   a funded-then-withdrawn account          → net zero, gross NOT zero
 *
 * The last one is the one a naive fix gets wrong: netting to zero and reporting
 * "no contribution ever happened" is a different and false claim.
