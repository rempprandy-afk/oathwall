/**
 * trencher — buying newly launched tokens, and knowing when to leave.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not alpha. Nothing in here knows which memecoin goes
 * up, and any code claiming otherwise would be lying to whoever runs it. What it
 * is: a risk FILTER with an exit discipline, over signals that are read from the
 * chain and checkable by anyone — depth, fully diluted value, age, drawdown from
 * entry, and how much liquidity has left since. No provider's score, no
 * "trending" list, nothing a promoter can manufacture.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY IS THE DESIGN. Entering requires EVERY condition to hold.
 * Leaving requires only ONE to break. That is deliberate and it is not
 * balanced-looking on purpose: losing money is far easier than making it, the
 * failure modes here are abrupt (liquidity pulled, price gone in one block), and
 * a filter that hesitates on the way out is worse than one that never entered.
 *
 * THE HONEST EXPECTATION. Most tokens this sees will fail its entry filter, and
 * most that pass will still lose money. It is sized by the scout budget for
 * exactly that reason — the budget is the risk control, not the analysis.
