/**
 * WHY A STRATEGY DID SOMETHING, in words a stranger can read.
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `decisions.reason` has always existed and only the LLM
 * strategist ever wrote one — `index.ts` calls `ensureDecision(intent, source)`
 * with no third argument for every deterministic strategy, so `steady-basket`,
 * the DEFAULT, produced thousands of decision rows a day with `reason` NULL.
 * An agent that trades all day and can say nothing about it is not much of an
 * agent to watch, and the public feed would have been empty for almost everyone.
 *
 * WHY A TYPED UNION AND NOT A STRING. This is the load-bearing decision in the
 * file, and it is about what may be PUBLISHED rather than about types.
 *
 * A strategy emits a `Why` — numbers, and symbols drawn from its own configured
 * legs. It never emits prose. `renderWhy` is the only function in the codebase
 * that turns one into a sentence, so every word on the public page was written
 * here, by us, in advance. No model, no tenant's custom strategy file, and no
 * chat message can reach it. Compare `decisions.reason` from the strategist,
 * which is model prose and must be capped and address-scanned before it is shown
 * to anybody, and `dropped_rule`, which is a template with a MODEL-SUPPLIED
 * symbol in the middle of it and can never be published verbatim at all.
 *
 * So publishability stops being a thing somebody has to remember and becomes a
 * property of the type system: if it went through `renderWhy`, it is safe.
 *
 * A CONSEQUENCE WORTH STATING. A tenant's own strategy file (`custom.ts`)
 * returns a bare `TradeIntent[]` and therefore cannot produce a `Why` at all.
 * Its decisions carry no reason and it never appears in the feed with prose.
 * That is deliberate: a strategy we did not write is a string we did not write.
 *
 * VOICE. Lower case, one em-dash, a figure and then what it means. No
 * exclamation, no prediction, no claim about an outcome the strategy cannot see
 * — it proposes trades, it does not learn whether they filled. Matched to the
 * notes `trencher.ts` already emits.
 *
 * LENGTH. Every rendered string stays under 220 characters, which is where
 * Telegram's `/why` truncates (`telegram/reads.ts`), so no surface anywhere cuts
 * one of these mid-word.
