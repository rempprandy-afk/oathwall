/**
 * THE MUTATION. Read-only unless explicitly told otherwise, and ordered so that
 * a failure anywhere leaves the ledger no worse than it found it.
 *
 * The order is the design. For each account:
 *
 *   1. INSERT the evidence-backed chain-log rows.
 *   2. VERIFY they landed and match the proposal exactly.
 *   3. ONLY THEN quarantine the legacy inferred rows.
 *   4. Recompute the contribution state.
 *   5. Recompute PortfolioQuality.
 *
 * Backwards there is a window in which an account has no contribution record at
 * all, and anything reading it in that window publishes the owner's principal as
 * profit — the same failure that made the phantom contribution and the phantom
 * high-water mark inseparable. If step 1 or 2 fails, step 3 does not run for
 * that account and nothing is quarantined.
 *
 * ONE TRANSACTION PER ACCOUNT, not one for the fleet. Twenty-four accounts in a
 * single transaction means one bad row rolls back twenty-three good repairs, and
 * holds a write lock on the ledger the whole fleet is mirroring into. Per-account
 * also makes `--resume` meaningful: an account either completed or did not.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER DELETED. Legacy rows are MOVED to `flows_quarantine` with
 * everything needed to put them back, plus the run that moved them and what
 * replaced them. A wrong row is evidence of a bug and the only remaining record
 * of what the fleet believed while it was live.
