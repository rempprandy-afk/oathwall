/**
 * A HOLD BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE SAYS STAY OUT, AND A HOLD BECAUSE THERE WAS
 * NOTHING TO READ, ARE THE SAME WORD AND DIFFERENT FINDINGS.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this report exists. Counting a blind run
 * as a considered hold credits the reasoner for a failure of the pipeline in
 * front of it — which is exactly the mistake the first week of shadow made,
 * where every decision was a hold and it took reading the prose to notice that
 * every lens had returned no-data.
