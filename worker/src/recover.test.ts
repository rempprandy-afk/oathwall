 * The escape hatch, which had no tests at all.
 *
 * `oathwall recover` is what an owner runs when everything else has failed —
 * after a kill switch, after a lost session key, when the funded address turns
 * out to be a smart account their wallet cannot see. It swept a token list
 * frozen at ship time, which meant it stranded two whole categories of money:
 * every token the owner added themselves (including every quarantined scout
 * buy), and the Morpho vault position — which is where the idle-cash sweep puts
 * most of the float on the FIRST tick. An agent doing exactly what it is
 * designed to do was reported by recovery as an empty account.

/**
 * The native-ETH sweep, and why its reserve errs large.

 * the sweep's own gas. That is true on testnet and wrong the moment someone
 * funds a real account — and worse, an account holding ETH and no tokens was
 * reported as having nothing to recover, which is the exact shape of "I funded
 * it and oathwall says it's empty".
 *
 * The reserve is the load-bearing number. Too small and the operation cannot be
 * paid for, so nothing moves at all — tokens included. Too large and some dust
 * stays. These tests pin that asymmetry.
