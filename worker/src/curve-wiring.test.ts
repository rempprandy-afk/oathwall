/**
 * THE BUG WAS THAT NOBODY SUPPLIED IT.
 *
 * `curveLegsNow` was declared in StrategyBuildOpts, forwarded by registry.ts,
 * and consumed by strategy.ts. Every layer looked wired. The production call
 * site never passed it, so `universe.curveLegs` was always undefined, the curve
 * arm of proposalsToIntents was unreachable, and every memecoin the model named
 * came back "not in the tradable universe" — while the same worker wired all of
 * the same data into the chat command an owner types by hand.
 *
 * A test that exercised the strategist would have passed. A test that read the
 * types would have passed. The only thing that catches this is asserting the
 * CALL SITE, which is what this file does — the same lesson wiring.test.ts was
 * written for after three dead wires shipped in one change.
