/**
 * FED FROM THE REAL BUILDER, deliberately.
 *
 * A fence tested against hand-written calldata proves the fence agrees with the
 * test author. Feeding it `buildTradeCalls`'s own output means the pass case is
 * the actual production shape, so an encoder change fails a test here rather
 * than quietly turning this into a wall (every trade refused) or an escape hatch
 * (every trade waved through). recovery-shape.test.ts makes the same argument
 * about Kernel's encoders and it is the reason that gate is trustworthy.
 *
 * The refusals are then MUTATIONS of that real output — one field moved at a
 * time — which is the only way to know the check is load-bearing rather than
 * incidentally true.
