/**
 * Carrying each tenant's ledger up to the shared database, so the dashboard can
 * see what its agent did.
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `db.ts` was built so a hosted deploy could put the ledger
 * in shared Postgres — its header says "so the web service can read what a
 * worker writes". But `childEnv` strips DATABASE_URL from every worker child, on
 * purpose: the URL reaches the shared grant store, and a compromised child must
 * not be able to read every tenant's rows. The two decisions are each defensible
 * and together they mean a child writes sqlite inside its own container while
 * the web service reads a Postgres nothing ever wrote to.
 *
 * The consequence was invisible and total: no trade tape, no positions, no
 * equity curve, no events and no reasoning on app.merrymen.dev, for anyone,
 * whatever the agent was doing. Balances still appeared because the web reads
 * those from the chain directly, which is exactly why it looked like a working
 * dashboard with a quiet agent.
 *
 * WHY MIRRORING RATHER THAN HANDING CHILDREN THE URL. Giving a child
 * DATABASE_URL is one line and undoes the isolation deliberately: every child
 * would be able to read every other tenant's ledger. The orchestrator already
 * has the URL, already supervises every child, and already knows where each
 * one's home is. It is the one process that can do this without widening
 * anybody's reach.
 *
 * EXACTLY-ONCE, BY TRANSACTION. Source rows carry ids that are only unique
 * WITHIN one child's database — two tenants both have event id 1 — so the id
 * cannot be the destination key. Instead each batch inserts its rows and
 * advances its watermark in ONE Postgres transaction: a crash mid-batch rolls
 * back both, and the next pass re-reads the same range. The alternative
 * (insert, then save the watermark) duplicates the tape every time a deploy
 * lands mid-copy, which on a trade ledger is worse than lagging.
