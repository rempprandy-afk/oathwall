/**
 * WHAT THE ORACLE PUBLISHED, over the last couple of months.
 *
 * The only price history this product can honestly draw. A Chainlink feed keeps
 * every round it has ever written and each one carries its own timestamp, so
 * the series is real observations rather than anything reconstructed — and it
 * costs ONE request: 400 rounds go into a single Multicall3 batch, measured at
 * 710ms against this chain with 400 of 400 answering.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A MARKET. It is what the oracle said, and the page must say so.
 * The feed runs 24/5 while the token trades 24/7, so between Friday's close and
 * Monday's open the feed is silent and the token is not.
 *
 * STOCK AND ETF TOKENS ONLY. A coin has no feed; its history would have to come
 * from the index, which is a different source with different failure modes and
 * a per-token request this file deliberately avoids making.
