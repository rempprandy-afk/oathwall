/**
 * What a trade ACTUALLY moved, read from the transaction receipt.
 *
 * Until this existed, a live fill was booked from the pre-trade quote — and not
 * even the quote, but `minOut`, the slippage floor. The comment defending it
 * was right about the direction (a fill can come in worse than quoted, never
 * better, so the bound is conservative on PRICE) and wrong about the
 * consequence: the tracked quantity ended up systematically SMALLER than the
 * balance actually sitting on-chain, by roughly slippageBps, on every buy.
 *
 * Every full exit then sells `held.rawBalance` — the real chain balance — which
 * exceeds the tracked basis, so applyFill flags it partlyUnbacked, returns zero
 * realized P&L, and writes NULL. The net effect was that a live round trip
 * could not book realized P&L AT ALL, while the warning blamed a position that
 * "predates basis tracking".
 *
 * Reading the receipt replaces an estimate of a settled fact with the fact.
 * Pure and side-effect free so it can be tested without a chain — the
 * orchestration in index.ts has no seams, which is how the original bug
 * survived a green test suite.
