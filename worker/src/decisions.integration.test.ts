/**
 * End-to-end proof of the attribution substrate against a REAL sqlite db (a
 * throwaway OATHWALL_HOME): a decision is written, a trade links to it via
 * decision_id, and /why joins them exactly — no time-window guessing.
 *
 * OATHWALL_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(), so the whole test
 * operates on an isolated temp database. node's --test runs each file in its own
 * process, so this env override never leaks into other suites.
