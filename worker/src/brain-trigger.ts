/**
 * WHEN IS IT WORTH WAKING BRAIN AT ALL?
 *
 * The tick runs every 240 seconds. A Brain run costs 5-11 model calls and 4-10
 * seconds; wiring it to the tick unconditionally would be 360 runs per agent per
 * day, 24 agents, for a market that mostly did nothing — and the fleet has
 * already had one incident where an unwatched background feature emptied a daily
 * token allowance.
 *
 * So the expensive thing is gated by a cheap one. This module is deterministic,
 * pure, and calls no model: it looks at what changed since the last run and
 * decides whether anything did. THAT IS THE POINT — a trigger layer that needed
 * a model to decide whether to call a model would cost what it was meant to save.
 *
 * COOLDOWN IS PER REASON, not global. A price move and a portfolio change are
 * different questions, and a global cooldown would let a stale price trigger
 * suppress a genuine risk event minutes later.
