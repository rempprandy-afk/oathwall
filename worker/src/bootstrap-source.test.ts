 * THE SOLE LICENSOR OF AN OPENING BALANCE, TESTED.

 * `deriveBootstrapAccounting` is the only thing in the system that can say
 * `no-prior-accounting`, and that arm is the only thing that permits booking a
 * whole balance as a new contribution. It shipped with no test at all, and the
 * defect that got through was as bad as defects get: it queried the ledger by
 * the OWNER address while every table keys on the SMART ACCOUNT, so every funded
 * tenant would have read as brand new and been re-booked on every deploy — with
 * the parent's explicit blessing, which is strictly worse than the inference it
 * replaced.
 *
 * So the tests below assert on the PARAMETERS, not only the verdict. A fake `Db`
 * records what it was asked; getting the right answer from the wrong key is the
 * failure mode, and only the parameter can see it.
