/**
 * SUNK IS SUNK, AND THE NEXT TRADE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE DECIDED.
 *
 * The canary paid 6.97 USDG of gas on a 10 USDG book, and a model handed that
 * total divided by four operations — 1.74 a trade against trades of 1.67 —
 * would correctly conclude that trading is pointless, about a number that is
 * wrong. 5.51M of the 6.02M gas in the first operation was the account
 * deployment and the permission wall: paid once, already paid, and irrelevant
 * to whether the next trade is worth making.
