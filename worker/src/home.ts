/**
 * ~/.merrymen — the user's home for everything that is THEIRS: settings,
 * grant, ledger, heartbeat, and their strategies. The install location
 * (npm global dir or a checkout) is disposable; upgrades and reinstalls
 * never touch user data. Override with MERRYMEN_HOME for tests/multi-agent.
 *
 * THE SINGLE DEFINITION. The web tier imports this exact module via the
 * `@merrymen/home` tsconfig alias — there is no second copy under web/src/lib.
 * There used to be, and it had drifted: it lacked the telegram/virtuals/paused/
 * scratch paths and mkdir'd eagerly on every merrymenHome() call. Two copies of
 * "where the grant lives" means the web tier can read a path the worker never
 * wrote, which under multi-tenant hosting strands a funded account. So both
 * sides derive every path from the one map below.
 *
 * Legacy migration: early versions kept data in <repo>/.data. If that exists
 * and the home file doesn't, files are copied over once, so nothing is lost.
