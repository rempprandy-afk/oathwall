/**
 * THE SHARED-TABLE HALF OF THE COMMAND CHANNEL.
 *
 * Hosted only, and only the leg between the dashboard and the orchestrator:
 * the web writes here, the orchestrator ferries into each child home as a
 * file, and the child claims by unlinking it (command-files.ts). Children
 * cannot read this table — CHILD_SECRET_STRIP removes DATABASE_URL on purpose.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING IT. These tests drive enqueue and claim against ONE
 * store handle with ONE constant key, so they prove the SQL and nothing about
 * the seam the feature crosses. The first version of this channel passed every
 * one of them while being completely non-functional hosted — the row went to
 * Postgres under the tenant wallet, and the child queried its own sqlite for a
 * smart account. Both defects were invisible here by construction.
 *
 * The seam is covered by command-files.ts, with real directories and a real
 * unlink. `claimCommand` below is retained for the self-hosted single-process
 * case and as the orchestrator ferry deliverable-marking primitive.
