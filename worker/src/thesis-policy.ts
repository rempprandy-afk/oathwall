/**
 * WHAT AN AGENT MAY SAY IN PUBLIC.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES UNDER worker/ AND NOT web/lib. It was in web/src/lib, which
 * was right while a browser was the only reader. The move anticipates a second:
 * the orchestrator is to materialise each child's followed theses into a file
 * the agent's desk reads, and what it writes must be EXACTLY what the public
 * feed publishes — same allowlist, same address backstop, same fail-closed
 * default.
 *
 * THAT SECOND READER NOW EXISTS: peer-theses.ts queries followed agents on the
 * orchestrator's side and every row leaves through the gate below, which is what
 * makes "a peer file can only contain what the public feed publishes" a property
 * rather than a promise. It did not exist for the three weeks this paragraph
 * described it in the present tense — the failure mode the rest of this module
 * exists to prevent, committed in a comment about it.
 * The worker cannot import from web/src (imports.test.ts forbids @oathwall/*
 * under worker/src, and web/src is not aliased inward at all), so the choice
 * was to move the module or keep a second copy. A second copy of a PUBLICATION
 * POLICY is the worst option available: the two readers drift into different
 * ideas of what may be published, and the drift stays invisible until
 * something private appears on a page. So it moved, and web/src/lib/thesis.ts
 * is a re-export. The module has no imports at all, which is what made that
 * mechanical — it is pure, DB-free, fetch-free and env-free, as below.
 *
 * This is the only gate between the decisions table and a page anybody can
 * read, and the decisions table was never built to be published. Three things
 * in it are actively unsafe, and none of them look it:
 *
 *   1. A `chat`-sourced reason embeds a RAW COUNTERPARTY ADDRESS by template —
 *      `owner asked to transfer 25 USDG to 0x… in chat` — unconditionally, on
 *      every chat transfer. Publishing one doxxes a third party and the amount.
 *
 *   2. The strategist is handed the whole signals snapshot — cash, vault,
 *      equity, every holding's dollar value — and its schema invites it to cite
 *      figures. A reason quoting the owner's balance sheet is within the design.
 *
 *   3. `dropped_rule` is a template with a MODEL-SUPPLIED HOLE in it:
 *      `#0 <symbol>: nothing held to sell`, where `<symbol>` is validated only
 *      as `typeof === "string"` — no length cap, no charset. It can never be
 *      published verbatim, at any length, however harmless it looks.
 *
 * SO THIS IS A WHITELIST, and it fails closed. A source nobody has classified
 * publishes nothing — not a redacted version, nothing. `SOURCE_POLICY` has no
 * fallthrough case by construction: an unknown key is `undefined`, and
 * `undefined` drops the row.
 *
 * WHY DROPPING RATHER THAN REDACTING. The address backstop below discards the
 * whole thesis rather than masking the match. Redaction implies we understood
 * the string well enough to know what was left; we don't, and a redactor that
 * is wrong once publishes the thing it was written to catch. Dropping is what
 * fail-closed actually means.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER HERE AT ALL. `signals_json` is not a field on the input type,
 * because the route does not select it. Not filtered — absent. That is a
 * stronger guarantee than any check in this file, and it is deliberate.
 *
 * PURE. No database, no fetch, no environment. It takes a row and returns a
 * post or null, so the whole policy is testable as a table.

 * SOURCES WHOSE DECISIONS CANNOT REACH A TRADE.

 * Brain is wired to think and to nothing else: there is no path from a

 * the absence by reading the imports rather than by trusting this comment.
 *
 * That absence has to survive the trip to a public page, and it very nearly did
 * not. A shadow row arrives with `action: "buy"`, a symbol, a size and a NULL
 * status — which is indistinguishable, to every gate below, from a real buy
 * whose trade has not landed yet. It would have been published as
 * `outcome: "pending"`, and the feed's badge function turns a pending buy into
 * the word "BUYING". An agent that cannot trade would have announced that it
 * was trading, in its own voice, on a page anybody can read.
 *
 * So a shadow source gets its own outcome arm and its own head, and both say
 * the conditional out loud: "would buy TSLA 5.00 USDG · a stated intention".

 * — the post says so.
