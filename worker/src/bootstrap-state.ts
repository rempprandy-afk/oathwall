/**
 * WHAT THE ORCHESTRATOR TELLS A CHILD ABOUT ITS OWN MONEY, BEFORE IT TRADES.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. A hosted child's SQLite lives in an ephemeral
 * container directory. Every redeploy hands the worker an EMPTY database, and
 * the accounting code read that emptiness as a fact about the world:
 *
 *     if (equityUsdg > 0n && highWaterMarkUsdg === 0n) record(equityUsdg, "opening balance")
 *
 * "No high-water mark on record AND there is money here" was taken to mean
 * "this money just arrived". In self-hosted mode that inference is sound — the
 * database outlives the process, so an empty one really is a new agent. In
 * hosted mode it is false on every single redeploy, and the canary booked its
 * 10 USDG as a brand-new contribution three separate times. Nothing about the
 * account changed; only the container did.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS NOT MERELY A REPORTING ERROR. `record()` also calls
 * `adjustAgentHwm`, so each phantom contribution raised the high-water mark by
 * the same amount. The two errors cancelled, which is why no fee was wrongly
 * charged and why nobody noticed. That cancellation is also the trap: DELETING
 * the phantom contribution on its own would leave the restored HWM at zero, and
 * the next equity mark would hand the whole principal to `accrueAboveHwm` as
 * profit and take a performance fee on the owner's own capital. The two figures
 * have to be restored together or neither. That is why this file carries the
 * HWM beside the contributions rather than just the contributions.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. The orchestrator holds `DATABASE_URL` and the child
 * never will (`CHILD_SECRET_STRIP`), so the durable accounting state is derived
 * from Postgres by the parent and delivered as a small private file in the
 * child's own home — the same model as `grant.json`, `settings.json` and
 * `peers.json`. It is a versioned bootstrap CONTRACT, not a one-off HWM dump:
 * other things the parent knows and the child cannot will want the same channel.
 *
 * AND IT FAILS CLOSED. Missing, malformed, stale, or written from a Postgres
 * that would not answer, the child does NOT fall back to the old inference. It
 * marks contribution truth UNKNOWN and books nothing. An agent that cannot say
 * what was contributed cannot say what it earned, and saying so is the whole
 * point — a fabricated contribution is worse than an absent one, because a
 * number nobody flags gets believed.
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT, field by field ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EVERY FIELD HAS A CONSUMER. That is a rule, not an observation. A value that
 * is derived, transported, validated and then dropped is worse than an absent
 * one: it creates the impression that the bootstrap state restores more truth
 * than it does, and the strict validation makes the impression convincing. Four
 * fields failed that test on the first pass and were removed rather than kept
 * "for later" — `asOfBlock` (declared reserved, never written), `ownerAddress`
 * (written by the parent, structurally dropped by `classifyAnchor`),
 * `anchorNetContributionsUsdg` and `restartDriftUsdg` (both assigned in the
 * child and read by nothing).

 *                                accountingLicence → equality with the above,

 * from a withdrawal from an in-flight UserOperation that landed while the

 * inflight-reconcile, so inferring it here would double-count it with the wrong
 * sign. An inferred delta is not an actual capital-flow event.
 *
 * The mechanism that DOES book a real deposit made during downtime is the chain
 * scan, which reads USDG Transfer logs and gives every flow a transaction hash.
 * When it is off or did not cover the window, a material delta means
 * contributions are no longer fully known — recorded as a gap, not papered over.
