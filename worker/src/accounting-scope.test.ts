 * just closed as the new one's opening balance. That is only correct if
 * contributions are read PER EPOCH — and one of the two readers was not.
 * `getNetContributionsUsdg` summed every row for the agent while the web's
 * identical query carried an epoch predicate.
 *
 * It never fired, and the reason it never fired is the interesting part: the
 * only agents ever bumped were those with rows predating the accounting fix, and
 * those rows predate the flows table too — so epoch 1 held no flows and a
 * lifetime sum happened to equal the current epoch's. Accidentally correct is not
 * correct, and the accident stops holding the moment an agent funded on today's
 * code is bumped for any future reason.
