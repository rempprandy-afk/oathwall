/**
 * The per-tenant grant store — durable, isolated, and encrypted at rest.
 *
 * Proven against a real temp filesystem: two tenants never see each other's
 * grant, the session key on disk is CIPHERTEXT not plaintext, a grant carrying
 * an owner key is refused, and a grant whose owner isn't the tenant is refused.
 * Each of those is a fund-safety property, so each gets its own assertion.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before the store resolves its dir; node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
