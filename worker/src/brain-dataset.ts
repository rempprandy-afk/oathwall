/**
 * THE SHADOW DATASET, read back out of the tape.
 *
 * Every field here is already persisted — `brain-shadow.ts` writes the whole
 * decision into `decisions.signals_json` on every run. What was missing was any
 * way to READ it: shared Postgres is private-network-only, and `railway logs`
 * is a 503-line snapshot that a fleet of 24 children fills in about a minute.
 * Thirty decisions collected over an afternoon are durable in the database and
 * invisible to anybody trying to look at them.
 *
 * So this is the read side, and it is deliberately a REPORT rather than an
 * export: the questions it answers are the ones a cohort is being run to
 * answer, and each one is a column somebody has to be able to argue with.
 *
 *   does Brain produce differentiated opinions across agents and assets?
 *   does it HOLD for good reasons, or out of generic caution?
 *   does confidence move with evidence?
 *   how often is execution economics the reason not to trade?
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THE WHOLE THING TURNS ON is between a hold that means "the
 * evidence says stay out" and a hold that means "there was nothing to read".
 * Those are the same word and completely different findings, and the analyst
 * verdicts are what separate them: a run where every lens returned `no-data` is
 * a blind run, and counting it as a considered hold would flatter the reasoner
 * for a failure of the pipeline in front of it.
 *
 * PURE. It is handed rows and returns strings.
