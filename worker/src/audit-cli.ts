/**
 * `oathwall export` and `oathwall verify` — the two commands that make the
 * README's "verifiable, not claimed" true rather than aspirational.
 *
 * The pair is meant to be used by someone who does not trust the operator:
 *
 *   oathwall export > ledger.jsonl        # run by the operator
 *   oathwall verify ledger.jsonl          # run by anyone, anywhere
 *
 * `verify` deliberately reads NOTHING but the file it is handed. It does not
 * open ~/.oathwall, does not consult settings, and does not care which machine
 * produced the export — otherwise it would only be checking the operator's
 * ledger against itself, which proves nothing.
