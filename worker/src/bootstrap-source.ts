/**
 * DERIVING A CHILD'S ACCOUNTING ANCHOR FROM THE DURABLE DATABASE.
 *
 * The child cannot do this. `CHILD_SECRET_STRIP` removes `DATABASE_URL`
 * precisely so that one compromised tenant cannot read every other tenant's
 * ledger, and that isolation is not up for renegotiation to fix an accounting
 * bug. So the parent — which already holds the URL, already supervises every
 * child, and already writes three other private files into each child's home —
 * reads Postgres and hands down a summary.
 *
 * WHY POSTGRES RATHER THAN THE CHILD'S OWN SQLITE. Because the child's SQLite
 * is the thing that keeps disappearing. Reading the anchor out of the directory
 * a redeploy just emptied would produce a confident anchor full of zeroes,
 * which is the original bug wearing a new hat. The mirror has been carrying
 * `flows`, `equity`, `fee_accruals` and the `agents` row (with `hwm_usdg` and
 * `epoch`) up to Postgres all along; that copy is what survives a container.
 *
 * THE THREE ANSWERS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, and this file's whole job is to
 * keep them apart:
 *
 *   established         durable rows exist — resume from them
 *   no-prior-accounting the query SUCCEEDED and found nothing at all
 *   unknown             the query did not succeed
 *
 * The middle one is the only thing that licenses an opening-balance
 * contribution, and it is a positive finding, not a default. A database that
 * threw must never look like a database that answered "empty" — that
 * substitution is exactly how a redeploy came to be recorded as a deposit.

/**
 * A cash REAL (as the ledger stores it) to cash base units.
 *
 * The loss is real and worth naming: the durable columns are SQLite REAL /
 * Postgres double precision, so about 15-16 significant digits is already the
 * most that can be recovered from them, whatever the cash unit's precision.
 * Converting at the boundary is lossless with respect to what is actually
 * stored, and it is where the loss stops — everything downstream of the anchor
 * is integer.
 *
 * ⚠ WAS `BigInt(Math.round(v * 1e6))`. The 1e6 was not a rounding choice, it
 * was the cash unit, and at 18 decimals that expression returns a figure 10^12
 * too small — for the HIGH-WATER MARK and the contributions total, which is to
 * say for the two numbers that decide whether performance fees are owed and
 * whether the drawdown breaker has anything to measure against.
