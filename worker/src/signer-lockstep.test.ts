/**
 * TWO SIGNERS, ONE WALL — pinned as source, because signer orchestration has
 * no seams to test through.
 *
 * The failure family this guards is the repo's oldest scar, three times over:
 * a marker minted without its permission (the transfer saga — 24 days of
 * grants claiming a capability the wall never emitted), a permission granted
 * without its marker (the exactInput reverts — routes quoted, submitted, and
 * refused on-chain every tick), and two signers drifting until the phone and
 * the dashboard sealed different walls under the same name.
