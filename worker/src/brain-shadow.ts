/**
 * THE SHADOW PATH: an Agent thinks, and nothing happens.
 *
 * worker state → buildPortfolioSnapshot() → trigger → Brain → persist.
 *
 * EXECUTION IS DISCONNECTED BY ABSENCE, not by a flag. This module does not
 * import proposalsToIntents, checkPolicy, simulate or the executor, and nothing
 * it returns is shaped like an intent. A future version that connects execution
 * has to ADD an import, which is a reviewable act; a flag would be one edit by
 * someone who did not read this comment.
 *
 * THE SNAPSHOT IS BUILT BY CORE. `buildPortfolioSnapshot` is the only place
 * equity and P&L are computed, and this file passes it inputs rather than
 * arithmetic. Every figure Brain sees can be traced to one snapshot id.
 *
 * TRIGGER STATE IS DURABLE, and that is deliberate rather than tidy. The
 * accounting work spent weeks on a bug whose whole shape was "a redeploy makes
 * the child forget, so it books the same thing again" — and an AI budget has
 * exactly the same failure available to it. A child that forgot its cooldowns
 * would re-fire every reason on every deploy.
