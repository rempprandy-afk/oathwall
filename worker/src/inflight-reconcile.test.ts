/**
 * In-flight reconciliation core — proven without a chain via the ReconcileChain
 * seam. The invariants that keep the daily cap honest across an unclean restart:
 *   • a SUCCESSFUL op the ledger never recorded is surfaced as an orphan;
 *   • an op already in the ledger (any status) is NOT re-surfaced;
 *   • a REVERTED op is ignored — it moved nothing and counts toward no cap;
 *   • the notional is the |USDG leg| from the receipt, so a reconciled row
 *     counts exactly as the live path would have counted it.

/**
 * THE SIBLING SWEEP, and the bug that made it necessary.
 *
 * cf9b046 started writing a 'submitted' row BEFORE broadcasting, so a crash
 * between the send and the ledger write could not lose the hash. It also made
 * findOrphanOps blind to exactly those rows: `listOpHashes` selected every
 * non-null user_op_hash regardless of status, and findOrphanOps skips any hash
 * in that set. So the row the sweep exists to finish was the one it filtered
 * out — invisible forever, never journaled, absent from realized P&L, and still
 * charging the live rail.
 *
 * The store half of the fix is asserted in inflight-row.integration.test.ts,
 * against real SQL. This is the chain half.
