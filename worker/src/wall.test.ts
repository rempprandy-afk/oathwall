 * EVERY ADAPTER REACHES THE CHAIN — the assertion that was missing.

 * argument is an intersection with `WallOptions`: the field was accepted at the
 * call site and discarded one line later.
 *
 * That is the precise failure this whole file exists to prevent, and every other
 * Pons assertion here missed it by calling `buildCallPermissions` DIRECTLY —
 * bypassing the wrapper that both signers actually use. The one existing
 * `buildWallPolicies` test passes no adapters at all and counts policies.
 *
 * A grant signed through that path would carry the `pons-adapter` marker and a
 * sealed address over a call policy containing no `tradeExactIn` permission and
 * no adapter in the approve spender set. `grantPonsAdapter` would return the
 * address, `limitsFromGrant` would allow the target, `checkPolicy` would pass,
 * the arm-time liveness check would pass — and both calls would revert at the
 * wall. A mirror looser than the chain.
 *
 * So this asserts the WRAPPER, for both adapters, forever.
