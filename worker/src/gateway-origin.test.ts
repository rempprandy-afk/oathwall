/**
 * The gateway origin is written down in three places, and they must agree.
 *
 * There is no shared import that could enforce this. The website is a standalone
 * Next app that doesn't compile the TS core, and cli/bin.mjs is plain ESM that
 * can't import TypeScript at all — a constraint its own comments already note
 * about the provider list. So the value is mirrored by hand:
 *
 *   packages/core/src/token.ts   MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_ORIGIN  (the merrymen client)
 *   site/lib/gateway.ts          GATEWAY_ORIGIN           (the memescope page)
 *   cli/bin.mjs                  the merrymen provider's `key` hint, shown
 *                                during onboarding as where to claim a token
 *
 * Three hand-copies with one pending migration between them is a half-flip
 * waiting to happen: someone moves the client to ai.merrymen.dev, the website
 * keeps calling Railway, and the onboarding text sends people to a third thing.
 * Each would look fine in isolation. This test is the thing that notices.
