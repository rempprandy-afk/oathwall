/**
 * Multi-hop routing. Two things are load-bearing here and neither is obvious:
 *
 *  - The PATH ENCODING must be exactly right. It is packed bytes with no
 *    delimiters, so an off-by-one in the fee width doesn't throw — it silently
 *    addresses a different pool, or garbage.
 *  - The quote and the CALL must describe the same route. minOut is derived from
 *    whatever the quoter priced; executing a different route with that minOut
 *    means trading against a slippage bound computed for something else.
