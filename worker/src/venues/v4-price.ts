/**
 * Pricing a Uniswap v4 pool — the gap that stopped the agent trading memecoins.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Pons graduates a coin off its bonding curve into a
 * Uniswap **v4** pool, and v4 has no observation oracle: TWAP moved into hooks,
 * so a vanilla pool cannot be asked what its price was thirty minutes ago.
 * `readRoutedPrice` reads `observe()` and is therefore v3-only, so every
 * graduated coin came back unpriceable, `priceable` was false, and trencher
 * refused it before forming any judgement about the token. The agent could route
 * a v4 swap and execute one; it could not VALUE the thing it would be buying.
 *
 * THE SAFETY MODEL IS DIFFERENT, DELIBERATELY. `poolPriceUsable` rests on
 * spot-vs-TWAP divergence — a pool being pushed shows a spot that has run from
 * its own history. There is no history here, and synthesising a TWAP to satisfy
 * the existing guard would launder an unguarded price through a check built for
 * something else. `pons-price.ts` faced exactly this and refused; so does this.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES IT, and this is the part measurement changed. The first draft
 * checked a round trip and forgave whatever the fee explained. Then 163 live
 * pools were sampled:
 *
 *     LP fee bps    min 0   p25 200   median 8633   p75 9450   max 9910
 *     over 100bps   76.1%     over 5000bps  66.9%
 *     at or under 100bps — 23.9%, and that is the entire tradeable set
 *
 * The median graduated pool charges **86% to trade through it**. Forgiving the
 * fee would have waved every one of them through, because a 98.8% round trip is
 * exactly what an 89% fee predicts. On this chain THE FEE IS THE RUG, so the fee
 * is a first-class refusal and not a term to be netted out.
 *
 * Three more things measurement settled:
 *   - The fee is DYNAMIC. Keys carry 0x800000 (LPFeeLibrary's flag) and the live
 *     rate is in slot0's `lpFee`. Reading key.fee literally yields 167,772 bps.
 *   - Keys cannot be guessed — see venues/v4-keys.ts. They are read from
 *     Initialize events and verified by hashing back to the poolId.
 *   - Most pools quote against NATIVE ETH (address(0)), not USDG and not WETH,
 *     so a USD price usually needs a second leg.
 *
 * What this does NOT claim: it is a SPOT price. It values a holding; it is not
 * oracle-grade evidence, and `source: "v4"` keeps that visible to the dashboard
 * and keeps the token inside the scout budget's reach.

 * `maxFeeBps` is 100. Not a taste: the measured distribution is bimodal — a
 * cluster at or under 100 bps (23.9%) and a cluster above 5,000 (66.9%), with
 * very little between. Anywhere in that gap separates the same two populations,
 * and 100 bps is the edge of the honest one. It is also the point past which the
 * repo's own cost floor stops making sense: at ~47 bps of existing cost, a 100
 * bps venue fee already doubles the price of being right.
 *
 * `maxRoundTripBps` is 400 — the fee twice at the cap, plus room for ordinary
 * impact at the probe size. It catches the asymmetric pool a fee check alone
 * would miss: one that charges little to enter and refuses to let you leave.
 *
