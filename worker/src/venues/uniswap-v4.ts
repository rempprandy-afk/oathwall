/**
 * Uniswap v4 execution — a different shape of venue, not just a newer one.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGES FROM v3, and why each change matters here:
 *
 *  1. NO FACTORY. Every pool lives inside one PoolManager, identified by a
 *     PoolKey hashed into a poolId. You don't look a pool up; you compute the id
 *     of a key you guessed and ask whether it's initialized. That works for
 *     vanilla pools and CANNOT work for hooked ones — a hook address is
 *     unguessable — so anything launched through Pons/Doppler needs its real
 *     PoolKey discovered (Bitquery Initialize events) before it can be touched.
 *
 *  2. PERMIT2, NOT approve(). The router never pulls tokens directly. The
 *     account approves Permit2 once, then Permit2 grants the router a bounded,
 *     EXPIRING allowance. That's two approvals per swap instead of one, and both
 *     are new call-policy targets — which is why v4 needs a re-signed grant and
 *     v3 didn't.
 *
 *  3. COMMANDS, NOT A FUNCTION CALL. UniversalRouter.execute takes a byte string
 *     of commands and a matching array of encoded inputs. A v4 swap is one
 *     command (V4_SWAP) whose input is itself an action list: do the swap, pay
 *     what you owe, take what you're owed. Getting the action order or the
 *     encoding wrong doesn't throw a type error — it reverts on-chain, or worse,
 *     settles a different amount than the minOut was computed for.
 *
 * Everything in this file is pure encoding plus read-only calls. Nothing here
 * decides WHETHER to trade; it only says what a trade would look like.
