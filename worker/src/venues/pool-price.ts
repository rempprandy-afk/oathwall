/**
 * DEX price for assets with no Chainlink feed — the second step of memecoin
 * support, and the one that decides whether the safety wall stays real.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DELICATE. Chainlink is what makes oathwall's valuation
 * trustworthy: it's an external, expensive-to-move number. A DEX pool is not —
 * on a thin memecoin pool, anyone with moderate capital can push the spot price
 * for one block. That price would otherwise feed equity, P&L and the DRAWDOWN
 * BREAKER, so trusting spot would let an outsider fake your net worth or trip
 * your circuit breaker on demand. The safety wall would become decorative.
 *
 * THE SPLIT THIS MODULE IMPLEMENTS:
 *   • TWAP  → valuation and safety (equity, P&L, the breaker). Time-averaged
 *             through the pool's own oracle, so moving it means holding the
 *             price away from the market for the whole window and eating the
 *             arbitrage — expensive, not free.
 *   • SPOT  → execution sizing only. What you'd actually trade at right now.
 *             Wrong-but-current beats right-but-stale when you're sizing a swap.
 *
 * Plus two refusals, because a price you can't trust is worse than no price:
 *   • a LIQUIDITY FLOOR — a pool too thin to value is simply refused
 *   • a DIVERGENCE BAND — spot far from TWAP means someone is pushing the pool
 *     right now; refuse rather than trade into it
 *
 * Everything is quoted as USDG-per-whole-token in 8dp (`price8`), the same unit
 * Chainlink feeds already produce, so positionValueUsdg and the entire asset
 * model downstream need no changes at all.
