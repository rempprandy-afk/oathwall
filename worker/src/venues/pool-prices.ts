/**
 * Pool pricing for the tick: batch, cache, and — most importantly — REFUSE.
 *
 * pool-price.ts knows how to read one token's TWAP from Uniswap. This module is
 * what the tick actually calls, and it adds the three things a trading loop
 * needs that a single read doesn't:
 *
 *  1. A GUARD APPLIED EVERY TIME. Reads are cached; verdicts are not. The owner
 *     can tighten the liquidity floor mid-run and the very next tick honours it,
 *     because the cache holds the raw route and the judgement is re-made fresh.
 *
 *  2. A CACHE, because a routed price is expensive. Each token costs up to three
 *     getPool + three balanceOf + token0 + slot0 + observe PER LEG, and most of
 *     this chain's memecoins are two legs. At 50 tokens on a 15s tick that is
 *     thousands of RPC calls a minute for a number whose whole point is that it
 *     moves slowly — the TWAP window is 15 minutes.
 *
 *  3. A REASON when there's no price. "CATE isn't priced" is not actionable;
 *     "CATE's pool holds $312, below your $5,000 floor" tells the owner whether
 *     to lower the floor, or that the coin is simply too thin to trade.
 *
 * A refusal is the correct outcome, not a failure. A price nobody can trust is
 * worse than no price at all: it feeds equity, P&L and the drawdown breaker, so
 * a manipulable number lets an outsider fake the owner's net worth or trip their
 * circuit breaker on demand.

 * always win means one flaky call drops a held position's valuation, which pauses
 * equity, the high-water mark and the drawdown breaker for that tick. Letting the
 * old route always win means a pool that was genuinely drained keeps producing a
 * price forever.
 *
 * So: a route that fails to refresh is KEPT but does not have its age reset, and
 * it is dropped once it passes this bound. Comfortably inside the 15-minute TWAP
