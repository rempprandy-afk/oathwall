/**
 * Pricing a Pons bonding-curve token.
 *
 * WHY THIS CANNOT REUSE THE POOL PRICER. Every existing price path assumes a
 * Uniswap pool with an observation oracle behind it: `poolPriceUsable`
 * (venues/pool-price.ts) refuses with `no-twap` BEFORE it looks at depth or
 * divergence, because its whole safety model is "does spot agree with a
 * time-weighted average". A bonding curve has no observations to average, so
 * every curve token is structurally unpriceable there — which is why they show
 * as `priceable: false` and trencher's entry gate refuses them.
 *
 * The fix is NOT to synthesise a TWAP to get past that check. That would
 * launder an unguarded number through a guard designed for something else, and
 * the guard would then report a confidence it does not have. A curve needs its
 * own safety model, and this module says plainly what that model is:
 *
 *   OVERHANG IS THE GUARD. A constant-product curve's price is an exact
 *   function of its reserves — there is no oracle to disagree with and nothing
 *   to manipulate through a stale window. What hurts you is that the real quote
 *   reserve IS the aggregate cost basis of everyone ahead of you, and if they
 *   leave, the price returns to the virtual seed. See curveFloorDrawdownBps.
 *
 * AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT SAID "depth is the guard", and that was
 * an instinct imported from Uniswap where deeper is safer. On a bonding curve
 * it is backwards: more depth is MORE downside, not less, because depth is
 * other people's exit. Depth still sets a FLOOR — below a few hundred dollars
 * there is no market to speak of — but it is a liveness test, not a safety
 * margin, and the thing that bounds the risk is how much of the current price
 * is other people's money. Size matters too, but far less than it looks:
 * impact is bounded below by the seed, so a 300bps cap does not bind until
 * about $124 of notional and is dead code at the configured entry sizes.
 *
 * THE VIRTUAL SEED, AND THE BUG IT CAUSED HERE. Pons opens every curve with a
 * VIRTUAL quote reserve of exactly 40% of that curve's graduation threshold —
 * 1.68 ETH on a 4.2 ETH curve — while the contract holds none of the quote
 * asset at all. Verified on mainnet: fresh curves report `quoteReserve /
 * graduationThreshold() == 0.400000` with an on-chain balance of zero, and
 * where there IS real money, `r0 - 0.4 x threshold` matches the balance held
 * (0.0147 computed against 0.015 actual).
 *
 * The first version of this module reported that seed as depth. It would have
 * told the owner a curve holding $0 had $4,106 to sell into — on the very
 * figure the safety model rests on, and off by however much money was not
 * there. The module had already caught this exact hazard on the token side
 * ("the token side is not liquidity — it is inventory the curve mints") and
 * then made the same mistake on the quote side one field down.
 *
 * WHAT THE SEED DOES AND DOES NOT AFFECT. The constant product genuinely uses
 * the full reserve INCLUDING the seed — verified exact to 1 wei against real
 * buys — so spot price and price impact are correct computed from `quoteRaw`
 * and must not be "fixed". Only figures that claim something about REAL MONEY
 * — depth, and progress toward graduation — subtract it.
 *
 * The maths is pure and lives apart from the RPC so it can be tested against
 * figures read off mainnet — the same discipline fills.ts uses.
