/**
 * PancakeSwap v3 direct execution — the permissionless swap venue.
 *
 * WAS venues/uniswap.ts, AND IS A RE-POINT RATHER THAN A REWRITE. PancakeSwap
 * v3 is a Uniswap v3 fork: `quoteExactInputSingle` takes the same struct and
 * returns the same tuple, `exactInputSingle` takes the same params, and the
 * factory answers the same `getPool`. So the shape of this file survived the
 * chain move intact and only the addresses and the fee tiers changed.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FEE TIERS ARE NOT THE SAME, and that is the one difference that could
 * have passed review. Uniswap ships 100/500/3000/10000; PancakeSwap ships
 * 100/500/2500/10000. There is no 3000 pool here, and `getPool` answers a
 * missing tier with the zero address — indistinguishable from an unpooled pair.
 * A tier list carried over unchanged would have quietly dropped the middle of
 * the book out of routing and reported nothing.
 *
 * Flow per swap: QuoterV2 simulation across fee tiers (this IS the pre-trade
 * simulation — it reverts where the swap would revert and returns a gas
 * estimate we store as the receipt) → slippage-bounded minOut →
 * exactInputSingle through the SmartRouter.
 *
 * LIQUIDITY REALITY (2026-09-08), the inverse of what this file was written
 * against: the majors have deep pools at every tier. Round-trip cost measured
 * through QuoterV2 at a $10 size is 2 bps for WBNB, BTCB and ETH and 12 for
 * CAKE (scripts/probe-pancake-tradability.mts). The quoter still tells the
 * truth about impact before any money moves — a missing pool shows up as
 * no-quote and the trade is skipped.
 *
 * A TERRIBLE quote IS now skipped — by worker/src/impact.ts, which this comment
 * spent a long time claiming existed before it did. For most of this file's
 * life the sentence here read "skipped by the impact guard upstream" and there
 * was no such guard anywhere in the repo. The two settings that sound like one
 * — minPoolLiquidityUsdg and maxPriceDivergenceBps — gate whether a FEEDLESS
 * token can be PRICED (see venues/pool-price.ts); they have nothing to say
 * about whether a trade can be SIZED. So a quote 40% through the book got a
 * minOut 1% below itself and executed happily.
 *
 * The guard re-prices the chosen route at a small probe size (requoteRoute,
 * below) and compares average execution price to marginal — the pool fee
 * cancels between the two, leaving impact alone. minOut remains what it always
 * was and defends what it always defended: the price MOVING between the quote
 * and the fill. It was never able to judge the quote itself.
 *
 * Trades also record fill_slippage_bps (quoted vs received), so the flat
 * slippage constant can eventually be replaced by a measured distribution. The
 * depth engine in venues/depth.ts computes the same impact number exactly, and
 * is deliberately barred from reaching policy (see depth.invariant.test.ts) —
 * which is why the guard measures from the quoter instead.
