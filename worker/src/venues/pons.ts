/**
 * Pons launches — seeing the memecoins that never touch a Uniswap pool.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Discovery finds tokens by watching Uniswap Initialize
 * events (via Bitquery, the only source that decodes hooked v4 pools). That
 * finds nothing here: a Pons token launches onto its OWN bonding-curve contract
 * and has no pool at all until it graduates at 4.2 ETH raised. So the launchpad
 * where essentially every new token on this chain appears was, to merrymen,
 * completely invisible — not "hard to price", not "filtered out", simply never
 * seen. This reads the launchpad directly instead.
 *
 * WHAT IS VERIFIED, AND HOW. Pons publishes no ABI, so every constant here was
 * established against mainnet 4663 rather than read from documentation:
 *   - the factory has 24,177 bytes of code at the address below;
 *   - it emits this topic0 on launch — ~50 per 3,000 blocks, and 523 distinct
 *     tokens over 40,000 blocks, so the launchpad is genuinely busy;
 *   - the field order was fixed by probing a real launch (PIZZA): topic1
 *     answers symbol() as an ERC-20, topic2 answers token() pointing back at
 *     topic1 AND getReserves() — so it is the curve — and topic3 answers
 *     neither, so it is the creator.
 *
 * A CORRECTION WORTH KEEPING. This module first shipped watching topic0
 * 0x308c390e…, which looked right because its three indexed addresses probed as
 * (token, creator, curve). It is a DIFFERENT, secondary event: it fires ~12x
 * less often and about 205 blocks (~20s) AFTER the launch. Watching it silently
 * under-reported the launchpad by an order of magnitude. Two events on one
 * contract can both look like "the launch" when probed in isolation; the thing
 * that separated them was comparing when each fired for the same token.
