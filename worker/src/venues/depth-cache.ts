/**
 * Depth for the tick: cached, bounded, and never load-bearing.
 *
 * depth.ts knows how to map one pool. This is what the loop calls, and it adds
 * the three things a trading loop needs that a single read does not:
 *
 *  1. A CACHE, because liquidity moves far slower than price. A range is capital
 *     someone committed; it does not reprice every fifteen seconds the way a
 *     quote does. Reading it per tick would spend RPC re-deriving a number that
 *     had not changed.
 *
 *  2. A BUDGET. Depth is 3 multicalls per token. Fourteen tokens every tick is
 *     42 calls for context, next to a routed price read that already spends 28
 *     for a number the agent cannot trade without. So a bounded number of stale
 *     entries refresh per tick, oldest first, and everything else is served from
 *     cache. The whole set converges within a few ticks and stays there.
 *
 *  3. FAILURE THAT COSTS NOTHING. Depth is colour, not a price. If a read throws
 *     the entry is simply absent and the strategist proposes without it, exactly
 *     as it did before this existed. Nothing downstream may require it — which
 *     is also why it is optional on Snapshot rather than required.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO BECOME. Depth informs proposals. It must never
 * reach policy.ts, because a cap that moved with liquidity would be a cap an
 * attacker can manufacture by adding to a pool. depth.invariant.test.ts pins it.

 * How long a depth map stays fresh.
 *
 * Five minutes, against the price cache's sixty seconds, because the two answer
 * different questions. A price is what the next trade executes at; depth is the
 * shape of the book behind it, and that shape is capital people have parked. It
 * still churns — one pool showed 695 mints and 310 burns in a day — so this is
 * not "liquidity is static", it is "a five-minute-old shape is still the right
 * shape to size a $50 trade against".
