/**
 * Two things matter here.
 *
 * The credential CHOICE — the owner's own key must always win over the shared
 * holder gateway, because it's their quota, their limits, and nobody else in the
 * path. And the PROTOCOL switch: against a personal key the client sends real
 * GraphQL, but the gateway takes a named query and builds the GraphQL itself.
 * Sending raw GraphQL to the gateway would be rejected; sending a bare name to
 * Bitquery would be a syntax error. Getting this backwards fails silently-ish
 * and only for holders, which is the worst way for it to fail.
