/**
 * Pricing owner-held tokens that trade on a Pons bonding curve.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. `createPoolPriceReader` refuses a curve token before it
 * looks at anything, with `no-pool` — correctly, since there is no Uniswap pool
 * to read. So a token the owner added because they hold it on a curve was
 * simply unvalued: it fell out of `positions` and was carried at cost. This
 * gives it a number, with a safety model of its own.
 *
 * NOTHING IS CACHED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. `pool-prices.ts` caches a route for
 * 60 seconds because a 15-minute TWAP does not move meaningfully inside one. A
 * curve has no time-average at all: over 240 seconds the p99 price move among
 * active curves was 1,546 bps and the maximum 5,511 bps. Reusing that cache
 * would be a category error, so every tick reads the reserves fresh, and the
 * guard's `stale-read` check exists to catch anyone who later adds caching
 * without thinking about it.
 *
 * WHAT A CURVE QUOTE IS AND IS NOT. It is good enough to VALUE something already
 * held. It is not good enough to authorise a new buy — nothing checked it
 * against an oracle, because there is no oracle to check it against. That
 * distinction is not enforced here; it is enforced by the quote carrying
 * `source: "curve"`, which keeps the token inside the scout ceiling and out of
 * the high-water mark. If this module ever starts emitting `source: "pool"`,
 * both of those protections disappear silently.
