/**
 * Pricing a token that trades on a bonding curve.
 *
 * The thing under test is mostly REFUSAL. Most curves hold almost nothing and
 * roughly half are quoted in assets this repo cannot value at all, so the
 * common path is "no price, and here is why" — and the reason has to be the
 * true one, because it is what the owner reads.
 *
 * The one assertion that is really about safety is the source tag: a curve
 * quote must carry `source: "curve"`, because that single field is what keeps
 * the token inside the scout ceiling and out of the high-water mark. If this
 * module ever emitted "pool", both protections would vanish with nothing to
 * show for it.
