/**
 * WHERE THE MONEY IS STACKED — a price-level depth map read from the chain.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. There is no order book here to read. The previous chain had no
 * CLOB: Rialto's own OpenAPI says "No orderbook is exposed", the limit-order
 * contracts deployed on 4663 have 0-2 lifetime transactions, and the strategist
 * prompt has always told the model it cannot see one. Anything calling itself an
 * order book on this chain would be a fiction.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS INSTEAD, and why it is arguably better. Uniswap v3 liquidity is
 * CONCENTRATED: an LP commits capital to a specific price range, so the amount
 * sitting at each tick is a real, public, verifiable map of where capital is
 * parked. A dense band below spot absorbs selling the way a bid wall does, and a
 * dense band above absorbs buying. Unlike a book, nobody can spoof it — the
 * capital is posted, not promised, and you can check every number against the
 * explorer.
 *
 * AND IT IS EXACT. Within one range the pool is a constant-product curve, so the
 * cash needed to walk price from sqrtA to sqrtB is L·(sqrtB−sqrtA) exactly — not
 * an estimate. Summing that across the ladder reproduces what QuoterV2 returns
 * for the same trade to 0.0000% at sizes from $200 to $434k. The depth map is not
 * a picture OF the execution curve; it IS the execution curve, arrived at by
 * arithmetic instead of by a simulated swap per size.
 *
 * WHAT IT HONESTLY IS NOT, and this belongs in any copy that ships:
 *   - A v3 range is not a resting order. It is a two-sided quote that flips from
 *     bid to ask as price crosses it. Calling the lower half "bids" is a reading,
 *     not a fact about someone's intent.
 *   - LPs leave. One pool showed 695 mints and 310 burns in 24h. A wall is a
 *     photograph, not a promise, and it can be gone in a block.
 *   - There is no queue, no participant count, no cancellation to watch.
 *   - This is ONE pool. The router may fill across four, so a per-pool map
 *     understates true depth for a token that trades in several.
 *
 * PROPOSE SIDE ONLY. Everything here is read-only market colour. It reaches the
 * strategist and the Telegram reads; it does not reach policy.ts, and it must
 * never become an input to a cap. depth.invariant.test.ts pins that.
