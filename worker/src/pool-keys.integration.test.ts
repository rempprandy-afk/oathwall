/**
 * Discovered PoolKeys survive keyless re-sightings — proven against real sqlite.
 *
 * A key is learned ONCE, from the pool's Initialize event, and that sighting
 * may never happen again: later discovery passes go through the gateway (which
 * does not return key fields yet) or re-see the token without the event. If a
 * keyless upsert blanked the captured key, a hooked pool would be routable for
 * ten minutes and then silently never again — and nothing would error.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(); node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
