/**
 * THE HOLE THIS FILLS, and why exactly-once is the whole point.
 *
 * `childEnv` strips DATABASE_URL from every worker child, so a child writes
 * sqlite inside its own container while the web service reads a Postgres nothing
 * ever wrote to. The result was total and invisible: no tape, no positions, no
 * equity, no events and no reasoning on the hosted dashboard, for anyone,
 * whatever the agent was doing — while balances still showed, because the web
 * reads those from the chain. It looked like a working dashboard with a quiet
 * agent.
 *
 * Source ids are unique only WITHIN one child's database — two tenants both have
 * event id 1 — so the id cannot be the destination key. Rows and their watermark
 * therefore move in ONE transaction. Insert-then-save duplicates the trade tape
 * every time a deploy lands mid-copy, which on a ledger is worse than lagging.
