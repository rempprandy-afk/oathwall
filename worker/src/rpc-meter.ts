/**
 * WHAT WE ACTUALLY ASK THE CHAIN FOR, COUNTED.
 *
 * Nothing in the worker has ever known. Every transport is `http()` with no
 * options, built at five separate sites, so there is no chokepoint — nowhere to
 * count, and nowhere to put a limiter later.
 *
 * The gap this leaves is not academic. In the logs no `eth_call` has EVER
 * appeared in a rate-limit line, because every quote helper catches and returns
 * `null`; the only 429s that get seen are the handful that escape a catch. So
 * roughly 95% of the traffic by count is invisible, and any limiter sized
 * against what the logs show would be sized against the wrong number.
 *
 * THIS CHANGES NO BEHAVIOUR. It does not queue, delay, retry, batch, dedupe or
 * refuse. It forwards every request untouched and records what happened. That
 * is deliberate: the fleet is currently in a restart storm of its own making,
 * and the whole point of measuring first is to size the limiter against a
 * healthy fleet rather than against the storm.
 *
 * It is also the seam. When the limiter arrives it goes here, and no call site
 * changes.

/**
 * THE READ TRANSPORT FOR THIS CHAIN — the one place it is built.
 *
 * The header above says the limiter goes here, and the measurement it asked
 * for has now happened. From a hosted child, on 2026-09-06:
 *
 *   [rpc:read] 103 calls in 248s (0.42/s) · 81 err · 81 rate-limited ·
 *              peak concurrency 81 · eth_call 100/79err [rate-limited:79]
 *
 * and a tick that ends, over and over, "market unreadable — no trading this
 * tick". Thirty-two children, each holding its own `http()` with no options,
 * all pointed at one keyless public endpoint, all waking on the same cadence.
 * Nothing was wrong with the agents; they could not see the chain.
 *
 * The first fix is not a queue, it is BATCHING, because the traffic is already
 * the right shape for it: viem's `multicall` fans out per-token reads that are
 * issued together and awaited together, which is exactly the window a JSON-RPC
 * batch collects. Measured against rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com the node
 * answers a batch correctly (three calls, three results, one request), and the
 * same tick then costs a handful of requests instead of eighty.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not retry, dedupe, cache or reorder, and it
 * must not: the meter's own note is that a transport which changed an outcome
 * would be measuring itself. Batching changes how many HTTP requests carry the
 * calls, not which calls are made or what any of them returns.
 *
 * NOT FOR THE BUNDLER. `eth_sendUserOperation` lives under the send-edge rules
 * — persist the hash, send once, never re-send — and a batch that fails as a
 * unit is the wrong shape for an operation that must not be silently retried
 * alongside somebody else's read.
