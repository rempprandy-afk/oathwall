 * oathwall worker — the 24/7 loop.
 *
 * tick: refresh settings → sync grant → snapshot → strategy intents → policy
 * check → simulate → execute via session key → record
 *
 * TWO files are re-read every tick, so the web UI drives the worker with no
 * restarts:
 *   .data/grant.json     — sign a grant and the worker arms next tick; kill
 *                          switch deletes it and trading halts next tick
 *   .data/settings.json  — API keys, bundler URL, strategy and every trading
 *                          knob (see /settings in the web app). Connection
 *                          changes re-arm the executor; strategy changes
 *                          rebuild the strategy in place. Env vars remain the
 *                          fallback; precedence is file > env > default.
 *
 * Persistence: SQLite at .data/oathwall.db (node:sqlite) — no service, no keys.
 *
 * `--selftest` sends one policy-legal no-op UserOp (approve 0.000001 USDG)
 * through the FULL pipeline to prove grant → policy → bundler → on-chain
 * policy enforcement, end to end.

  /**
   * PAPER IS A CAPABILITY, not the absence of a bundler key.
   *
   * This used to read `!active.executor && cfg.paperTradingEnabled` — paper as
   * the accidental consequence of having nothing to sign with. That worked
   * self-hosted, where a missing key is the normal starting state, and it broke
   * completely hosted: the orchestrator injects the house bundler key into every
   * child, so `active.executor` is never null and NO HOSTED TENANT COULD EVER BE
   * IN PAPER MODE.
   *
   * The result was worse than a missing feature. A hosted tenant on testnet got
   * a LIVE executor building real swaps against router and token addresses that
   * exist only on mainnet — neither trading nor simulating, while the console
   * chip read LIVE and the chain card promised "a simulated book at real live
   * prices".
   *
   * So ask what the agent can actually DO. Three ways to be unable to trade for
   * real, each independently sufficient:
   *
   *  1. No signer. Nothing can be submitted.
   *  2. Not a tradeable chain. Every token and router oathwall knows is a
   *     mainnet-4663 deployment, so on any other chain a swap has no venue to
   *     route through — preflight.ts calls this a hard blocker for the same
   *     reason.
   *  3. No capital. A swap with nothing to sell is a refusal, not a trade.
   *
   * `paperTradingEnabled` KEEPS ITS MEANING and its `true` default: it is
   * permission to simulate rather than sit idle, not a request to simulate
   * instead of trading. Reading it as a mode selector would have been a
   * catastrophe — it defaults to true, so every funded mainnet agent in the
   * fleet would have quietly stopped trading and started reporting pretend
   * fills. Capability decides WHETHER we can trade; this flag only decides what
   * to do when we cannot.
   *
   * UNKNOWN IS NOT UNFUNDED. `lastCashUsdg` is null until the first balance read
   * of the process, and a null must never push a funded live agent into
   * simulation — an agent that thinks it is trading while writing pretend fills
   * is the single worst outcome available here, far worse than an idle tick. So
   * only a READ zero counts.

   * MISSING beat as stale the moment its 90-second grace expires — `beat ===
   * null` short-circuits the age comparison, so the 570-second threshold never
   * applies to a child that has not beaten yet. The stagger is spread over one
   * whole tick (240s hosted), so every child whose derived slot landed past 90
   * seconds was SIGKILLed before its first tick ever ran. And the slot is
   * derived from the tenant, so it is the SAME slot on every restart: those
   * children were killed, restarted, and killed again, permanently. Roughly
   * five-eighths of the fleet, and each restart paid for a fresh arm and a
   * 200,000-block getLogs sweep — which is the same kill → re-arm → rate-limit
   * loop the orchestrator's own watchdog comment was written about.
   *
   * The stagger was right and the heartbeat's contract was right; what was
   * wrong was making one contingent on the other. `heartbeat()` already says
   * it: "A heartbeat answers 'is this process alive'. That is true whether or
   * not a third party answered an HTTP request." It is equally true whether or
   * not a timer I added has elapsed.

   * "idle" is the honest mode here — nothing is armed until the first tick.
