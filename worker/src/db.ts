/**
 * The ledger's database driver — one async interface, two backends.
 *
 * The store (store.ts) is the single writer of the trade/equity/position/basis
 * ledger. It used to talk to node:sqlite synchronously. To let a HOSTED deploy
 * put that ledger in shared Postgres — so the web service can read what a worker
 * child writes, and it survives a redeploy — every store call is now async and
 * goes through this `Db` seam:
 *
 *   - SqliteDb (the default, and all self-hosted) wraps node:sqlite. Its
 *     operations are synchronous under the hood, so wrapping them as async
 *     changes NOTHING about behaviour — the same file, the same WAL, the same
 *     crash-atomic transactions. This is what keeps self-hosted byte-for-byte.
 *   - PgDb (added in the next stage, selected by DATABASE_URL) will run the same
 *     SQL against Postgres with placeholder + dialect translation.
 *
 * `?` placeholders and the sqlite spelling of SQL are the lingua franca here; a
 * Postgres backend translates them. Transactions run through `tx()` so the
 * Postgres backend can pin them to one connection (a pool.query-per-statement
 * transaction would scatter across connections and never commit as a unit).
