/**
 * A bonding curve survives in the candidate store — proven against real sqlite.
 *
 * TWO DISCOVERERS NOW WRITE THIS TABLE. The Uniswap/Bitquery pass and the Pons
 * launchpad pass both upsert onto `address`, and each knows things the other
 * does not: only the launchpad has a curve, and only the pool pass can price a
 * token in USD. Every test here is about one of the two blanking something the
 * other captured — the failure mode that produces no error, no log, and a
 * candidate that quietly stops qualifying.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is set before any store import runs getDb(); node's --test runs
 * each file in its own process, so the override never leaks.
