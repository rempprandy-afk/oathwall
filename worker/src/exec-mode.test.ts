/**
 * PAPER IS A CAPABILITY, and this is the function that decides it.
 *
 * The predecessor of this file modelled the rule and pinned the SOURCE against
 * the model with four regexes. That was the right instinct and it still missed
 * the bug, because it pinned where the rule was DEFINED and the bug was where
 * the rule was USED: the execution fork asked `!executor` — a fifth question
 * nobody had noticed was a separate question at all — and hosted, where the
 * house bundler key is always injected, it answered "live" for a fleet the tick
 * had already decided was paper.
 *
 * So the rule now lives in a real function and these tests call it. The source
 * pin at the bottom pins the CALL SITES, which is the half that was missing.
