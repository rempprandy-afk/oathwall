/**
 * THE CHECK THAT COMPARED A VALUE WITH ITSELF.
 *
 * session-account.ts has always carried two checks. The first rebuilds the
 * permission id WITHOUT passing the stored one, with a comment explaining that
 * passing it would make getIdentifier() echo the input and the comparison
 * tautological. The second — "SECOND, INDEPENDENT CHECK" — then built the
 * account WITH `address: params.accountParams.accountAddress` and compared
 * `account.address` against that same value.
 *
 * createKernelAccount.ts:263 is `accountAddress = address ?? (…derive…)`, so
 * supplying the address skips derivation entirely and the comparison could
 * never fail. A guard that reads as one and is not one is worse than no guard,
 * because it stops anyone writing the real one.
 *
 * These tests drive the REAL function over a REAL serialized grant. The only
 * thing stubbed is the chain, and it is stubbed precisely so the derived
 * address can be made to disagree with the signed one — which is the case that
 * cannot be constructed at all if the derivation never runs.
