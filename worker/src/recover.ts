/**
 * Fund recovery — sweep an agent's smart account back to a wallet you control,
 * signed by the OWNER key (the account's sudo validator), NOT the session key.
 *
 * Why this exists: the address you funded is an ERC-4337 (ZeroDev Kernel) smart
 * account — a counterfactual contract, not a plain EOA. Its owner private key
 * derives a DIFFERENT address, so importing that key into MetaMask shows an
 * empty wallet while the funds sit in the smart account. And after a kill switch
 * the session key is gone. The one thing that always works: rebuild the account
 * from the owner key as the sudo signer and have IT move the money out.
 *
 * The sudo validator has no session-key policies attached, so recovery is not
 * bound by the per-trade / daily caps — it can move the whole balance in one op.
 * The account pays its own gas from its native ETH (no paymaster), exactly like
 * the trading executor. Nothing here transmits the key: it signs one UserOp
 * locally and only the signed op reaches the bundler.
