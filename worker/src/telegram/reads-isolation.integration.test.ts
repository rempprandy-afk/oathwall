/**
 * Tenant isolation for the Telegram read formatters — the "one-way door".
 *
 * These reads used to select whole tables (equity, positions, trades, events,
 * decisions) with no agent filter, or resolve "the current agent" by guessing
 * the most-recently-active one. Fine while a database held exactly one tenant;
 * a cross-tenant LEAK the moment the ledger is shared. This proves the fix
 * against a REAL sqlite ledger holding TWO agents: every read scoped to Alice
 * returns Alice's rows and NEVER Bob's, and — in hosted mode — a read with no
 * agent refuses rather than falling back to the global guess.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOSTED is set so the no-fallback branch is exercised; MERRYMEN_HOME
 * is a throwaway temp db. node's --test runs each file in its own process, so
 * neither override leaks into another suite.
