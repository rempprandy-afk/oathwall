/**
 * THE LOOP THAT KILLED THE FLEET, PINNED SO IT CANNOT COME BACK.
 *
 * None of this was a race. `MERRYMEN_TICK_SECONDS=240` against
 * `WATCHDOG_STALE_SEC=180`, with the heartbeat written once per tick, means the
 * minimum gap between two beats exceeds the kill threshold — so every child was
 * SIGKILLed at ~185s, before its second tick ever ran. All 71 observed
 * `heartbeat stale` events landed in a 181-196s band, which is 180 plus one 15s
 * poll and nothing else.
 *
 * The kill fed a re-arm, the re-arm fed a 200,000-block getLogs sweep, the
 * sweep fed the rate limiting, the rate limiting killed the tick one line
 * before the heartbeat, and that fed the kill.
