/**
 * The hosted supervisor — one worker child per tenant.
 *
 * merrymen's worker keeps ~35 pieces of per-agent state (the `active` handle, the
 * money counters, the price/HWM caches, the discovery cursors) as locals INSIDE
 * main()'s closure, and only four true module globals (the sqlite handle, the
 * mainnet client, the grant-store cache, the ensureHome latch) — all per-process.
 * So a fresh PROCESS per tenant makes every one of them tenant-correct by
 * construction, with no in-process multiplexing to get wrong. That is the whole
 * tenancy model: this file fans main() out, one OS process at a time.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *  - reconcile: read the grant store, spawn a child for every tenant that has a
 *    grant and isn't running, stop the child of any tenant whose grant is gone
 *    (the kill switch);
 *  - each child gets its OWN MERRYMEN_HOME (…/children/<tenant>) with the tenant's
 *    session-key-only grant written to grant.json, and a curated env that carries
 *    the platform's house keys (bundler/RPC/LLM) but NOT the orchestrator-only
 *    secrets (the store DEK, the session secret, the database URL);
 *  - watchdog: a child whose heartbeat goes stale past a generous threshold is
 *    SIGKILLed and restarted — a JS timeout can't reclaim a spinning tick, only
 *    the OS can;
 *  - crash backoff, and a fleet-halt file that stands the whole band down.
 *
 * MULTI-REPLICA SAFETY. Before arming a tenant this takes a per-tenant Postgres
 * advisory lease (tenant-lease.ts) and holds it for the child's whole life, so a
 * second orchestrator replica can never also arm the same tenant and double its
 * daily spend. Without a shared database the lease is a no-op hold (one process
 * by construction). A lease that goes unhealthy — its connection dropped, so
 * Postgres released the lock — stands the child down rather than let it trade
 * unprotected.
 *
 * NOT YET (Phase B, before real funds): in-flight-UserOp reconciliation on
 * restart, so a SIGKILL between submit and ledger-write doesn't under-count
 * spend. That lives in the WORKER's arm path (it needs the chain client and the
 * ledger, which the child already has), and runs before the child seeds its
 * budget counters — noted at store.ts's fail-closed write and at the arm site.

 * fifteen seconds and A NEW SIGNATURE NEVER REACHED IT AT ALL.
 *
 * That is not a theoretical gap. `restoreAgentWallet`'s own doc calls itself
 * "the RE-SIGN path for widening the tradable set: adding a token in settings
 * can't reach into an already-signed key, so covering it means minting a new
 * grant over the same account." An owner does exactly that — adds a token,
 * re-signs, watches the server accept it, sees the new grant on /grant — and
 * their agent goes on refusing the token with `asset-allowlist` until something
 * unrelated restarts the child. The wall it is enforcing is the OLD one,
 * because the old one is the only file it has.
 *
 * The child is already willing: it re-reads `grant.json` every tick and re-arms
 * when `smartAccount` or `grantedAt` changes (index.ts:2620-2623). It was never
 * given the new file.
 *
 * WRITE ONLY ON CHANGE, and compare the WHOLE serialized grant rather than a
 * key. `grantedAt` is whole seconds — index.ts:2566-2568 makes that point about
 * its own dedup — so a key comparison here could miss a re-sign, and the cost
 * of being wrong is an agent enforcing a wall its owner has replaced. A string
 * compare cannot miss one. (The child's own re-arm still keys on `grantedAt`,
 * so two re-signs inside one second remain its edge, not ours.)
 *
 * NOT `writeGrantForChild`. That one also mints a public identity, which is
