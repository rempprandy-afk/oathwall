/**
 * THE MAGNITUDE CHECK THE MIGRATION TURNS ON, kept apart from every other
 * assertion in this file and deliberately written with a literal.
 *
 * Everything below states its expectation as `cashUnits(n)`, which is correct
 * and decimals-agnostic — and which would also pass, silently and forever, if
 * BOTH the valuation denominator and the cash constant were wrong in the same
 * direction. That is not a hypothetical pairing: the denominator was built from
 * a hardcoded `decimals + 20` that folded the old 6dp cash unit into a single
 * number, so a cash change and a denominator change are exactly the two edits
 * that travel together.
 *
 * So one test writes the answer out in full. One whole token at $250 is 250
 * cash units at 18 decimals, and that is 2.5e20 base units — not 2.5e8, which
 * is what this file asserted before the move and what a `+ 20` denominator
 * still produces. The gap between those two numbers is 10^12, which is the
 * factor by which a wrong exponent misvalues the book that feeds the drawdown
 * breaker: too small freezes the agent on a phantom crash, too large means the
 * breaker can never fire. Neither one looks broken from outside.
