/**
 * WHEN TO SPEND A VENDOR REQUEST, AND ON WHICH SYMBOLS.
 *
 * The scheduling half of the news desk. It exists because the constraint that
 * actually binds is not latency or tokens — it is REQUESTS PER DAY, a number in
 * the low hundreds, against a fleet that wakes several times an hour and grows
 * by tenant. Left implicit, that budget is spent by lunchtime and every
 * afternoon decision is blind while believing itself informed.
 *
 * BRAIN WAKING DOES NOT IMPLY FETCHING. The refresh runs on this module's own
 * clock inside the orchestrator; a child reads whatever file is there. Ten
 * agents thinking at once cost zero requests.
 *
 * THE THREE NUMBERS, and how each is derived rather than chosen:
 *
 *   ttlSec       86400 / (daily allowance, less a tenth held back) — the
 *                fastest refresh the allowance can sustain for a whole day,
 *                floored at five minutes and capped at an hour. If the budget
 *                cannot afford hourly refresh, the answer is fewer symbols, not
 *                a staler desk.
 *   maxSymbols   never more than the articles one request may return. This is
 *                the honesty constraint and it is easy to miss: asking about
 *                eight symbols on a tier that returns three stories guarantees
 *                five symbols come back empty, and the desk would report those
 *                five as "we asked and the world was quiet" when the truth is
 *                that they were crowded out. A symbol we cannot actually hear
 *                about must be reported as not-fetched, not as quiet.
 *   rotation     when the fleet wants more symbols than one request can carry,
 *                the window index selects which slice is asked. Deterministic,
 *                so a replay of window N asks what window N asked.
 *
 * Batching is free in the only currency that matters: one request naming three
 * symbols costs exactly what one request naming one symbol costs.

/**
 * Which slice of the fleet's wanted symbols this window asks about.
 *
 * The rotation is anchored on the window index so the same window always
 * produces the same ask, and when everything fits, everything is asked and
 * rotation never runs.
 *
 * `alwaysAsk` IS THE PART THAT HAD TO BE ADDED. The caller passes its symbols
 * in priority order and this function used to throw that order away the moment
 * rotation ran: `start` is derived from the clock, so a held position could sit
 * unheard-about for hours while the window walked a watch universe of names
 * nobody owns. Production showed it — the fleet held TSLA and asked about
 * GOOGL, AMZN and NVDA. Priority order that only survives while it makes no
 * difference is not priority order.
 *
 * So held names take their slots first and the rotation fills what is left. If
 * the held book alone is larger than one request can carry, the rotation runs
 * INSIDE it — a big book still gets round-robin coverage, and never loses a
 * slot to a name it does not own.
