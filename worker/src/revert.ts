/**
 * WHAT A REVERT MEANT, so the loop can do something other than repeat itself.
 *
 * `index.ts` put ninety characters of the raw error into `reject_rule` and
 * derived nothing. That is free-form text of unbounded cardinality in a column
 * every other producer fills from a small vocabulary — and it sat in a headless
 * loop with a 60-second tick and no human reading it. **A revert you cannot
 * classify is a revert you repeat.** The 1,242 identical `ops-cap` rejections of
 * 2026-07-15 are what that looks like from the outside.
 *
 * That is also why this is worth more here than in the tool it is borrowed from.
 * Vex (github.com/Vex-Foundation/Vex, used with its author's permission) maps
 * revert strings to a taxonomy so a PERSON is told which parameter to change.
 * merrymen has no person in the loop, so the classification has to feed back
 * into the next decision itself — see `retryable`.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR THIS TABLE, taken from theirs verbatim: **add nothing from
 * memory.** Every pattern below is either a string this codebase itself emits
 * (grep the reference beside it) or a documented EntryPoint/Kernel code. A
 * plausible-looking string that no contract on this chain actually returns is
 * worse than no entry: it produces confident misclassification of the one
 * failure someone is trying to understand.
 *
 * So the table starts SMALL. `unclassified` is the honest default and is
 * treated as retryable — it must never become the bucket that quietly suppresses
 * a token because nobody recognised the message.
 */

/**
 * What kind of failure this was, and therefore what the loop should do next.
 *
 * Deliberately about the REMEDY rather than the cause: two different reverts
 * that call for the same response are one class here, because the only consumer

 * mirrored here surfaces as an unclassified revert rather than as a confident
 * misclassification.
 *
 * Solidity revert data is `selector ++ abi.encode(args)`, so matching the leading

 * different RPCs hex-encode with different case.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the errors PONS ITSELF reverts with. Those come

 * of source. A scoping pass suggested Pons's SlippageExceeded is 0x71c4efed;
 * deriving `SlippageExceeded()` gives 0x8199f5f3, so the two disagree and neither
 * is evidence. A selector guessed from a plausible name is exactly the

 * `unclassified` — retryable, and visible — until one is observed on chain and
 * added with the transaction that produced it.
