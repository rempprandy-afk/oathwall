/**
 * THE DRY RUN: what the ledger says, what the chain says, and exactly what would
 * change. Nothing here writes.
 *
 * The diagnosis established that quarantine-only is not a repair: all 363 hosted
 * flow rows are `inferred` with no transaction, so removing them leaves every
 * agent at zero contributions and the tool refuses on all of them. The rows that
 * SHOULD be there were never written, because `chain-log` has no producer in
 * production — the deposit scan defaults off.
 *
 * So a repair has two halves and an order that cannot be reversed:
 *
 *   1. INSERT the evidence-backed capital flows read off the chain.
 *   2. THEN quarantine the legacy inferred rows.
 *
 * Backwards, there is a window in which an agent has no contribution record at
 * all, and anything reading it in that window publishes the owner's principal as
 * profit. Same reason the high-water mark and the phantom contribution had to be
 * restored together rather than one at a time.
 *
 * PAPER IS NOT REAL. An account with no on-chain USDG history has contributed
 * exactly nothing, whatever its simulated book says — and the simulated book is
 * where the −59,000 / −26,000 / −7,900 USDG "contributions" came from. This
 * refuses to manufacture a real capital row from a paper balance, and says so.
