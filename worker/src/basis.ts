/**
 * Cost basis + realized P&L — the accounting that makes "did that trade make
 * money?" a number instead of a vibe.
 *
 * WEIGHTED-AVERAGE cost, not FIFO lots. One row per (agent, symbol): the raw
 * quantity held and the total USDG it cost. A sell removes cost pro-rata and
 * books the difference as realized P&L. Average cost is the right call here —
 * merrymen isn't a tax reporter, and one row per symbol has no lot-matching
 * complexity to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * UNITS (the part that must never drift):
 *   qtyRaw   — 18dp RAW token units, exactly what transfer() moves
 *   costUsdg — 6dp USDG, the total paid for the currently-held qtyRaw
 *
 * Basis is per RAW unit, which makes it SPLIT-INVARIANT for free: ERC-8056
 * corporate actions change uiMultiplier(), never rawBalance, so a 2-for-1 split
 * leaves both qtyRaw and costUsdg untouched — the position is worth the same and
 * cost the same. Storing basis per UI share would silently halve on every split.
 *
 * Everything here is pure integer arithmetic. Truncation on the pro-rata cost
 * split is deliberate and self-cancelling: the SAME truncated costOut is added
 * to realized and subtracted from the remaining basis, so the identity
 *
 *     Σ realized + unrealized  ==  proceeds + marketValue − spent
 *
 * holds EXACTLY for any sequence of fills (see basis.test.ts).
