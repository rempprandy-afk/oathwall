/**
 * Fail-closed spend writes: addTrade / setAgentHwm / addFeeAccrual now REPORT
 * whether they persisted instead of swallowing the failure into a console.error.
 *
 * The report is what lets processIntent keep a money-moving fill's spend counted
 * when its ledger row does not land — a swallowed failure under-counts
 * getSpentTodayUsdg and loosens the daily cap, the unsafe direction. This proves
 * the signal at the store boundary: a good write returns true, a write that
 * throws (a NOT NULL violation on the money-moving path) returns false.
 *
 * MERRYMEN_HOME is a throwaway temp db; node's --test isolates the process.
