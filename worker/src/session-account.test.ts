 * THE ASSERTION WHOSE ABSENCE LET THIS SHIP.
 *
 * wall.test.ts pins WALL_POLICY_FLAG's VALUE — that it is
 * PolicyFlags.NOT_FOR_VALIDATE_SIG — and stops there. A constant being right
 * says nothing about whether it survives the trip to the chain, and it did not:
 * the flag is hashed into the permission id and concatenated into the enable
 * data at sign time, then dropped by getPluginSerializationParams and defaulted
 * back to FOR_ALL_VALIDATION on the way in.
 *
 * These tests are about the SEAM, not the constant. They construct validators
 * the way the signers and the worker each do, and compare what the chain would
 * actually see.
 *
 * No network: toPermissionValidator only reads `client.chain.id` when the chain
 * is present (toPermissionValidator.ts:41), so a client with a chain never
 * dials out. That is why this can be a unit test at all.
