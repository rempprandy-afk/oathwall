/**
 * merrymen dashboard service worker.
 *
 * THE CACHING RULE HERE IS A SAFETY RULE, NOT A PERFORMANCE ONE.
 *
 * This app shows equity, open positions, live prices and a kill switch. A cached
 * API response is not a stale pixel — it is a wrong number that someone might
 * act on, or a kill switch that appears to have fired when it didn't. So:
 *
 *   /api/**        NEVER cached. Network only. If the network is gone the caller
 *                  gets an error and the UI says so, which is the truth.
 *   /_next/static  Cache-first. Content-hashed by the build, so a cached file can
 *                  never be the wrong version of itself.
 *   fonts, icons   Cache-first. Same reasoning.
 *   navigations    Network-first, falling back to /offline.html — so opening the
 *                  installed app with no connection explains itself instead of
 *                  showing the browser's dinosaur.
 *
 * Nothing else is cached. If you are tempted to add a stale-while-revalidate for
 * an API route to make the app feel snappier, don't: "feels live but isn't" is
 * the single worst property a trading UI can have.
