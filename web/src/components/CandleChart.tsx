/**
 * THE PRICE CHART, drawn by TradingView's lightweight-charts.
 *
 * The one place in this product where a third-party renderer earns its bytes.
 * Every other chart here is server-rendered SVG, and that is right for a
 * sparkline or an oracle series — but a candle chart is a crosshair, a
 * scrollable time axis, a price scale that re-fits as you pan, and a tooltip
 * that follows the pointer. Hand-rolling those is a month of work to arrive
 * where a 60kB library already is. (Measured from the installed tarball:
 * 60,575 bytes gzipped, 189,213 raw. The first draft of this comment said 45kB
 * from memory, in a codebase that pins its figures.)
 *
 * IT IS LOADED ONLY WHEN A CHART ACTUALLY DRAWS. The import is dynamic and
 * inside an effect, so a token page with no candles — every stock token, every
 * coin the index has never returned — ships none of it.
 *
 * IT IS NOT SERVER-RENDERED, which is the cost. The bars arrive with the HTML
 * and the canvas paints on hydration, so this reserves its own height up front:
 * a chart that pushes the theses down when it appears is the layout shift the
 * rest of the redesign has been removing.

/**
 * Bars, plus an empty entry for every slot that has none.
 *
 * THE LARGEST HONESTY DEFECT IN THE FIRST VERSION. lightweight-charts places
 * bars at CONSECUTIVE time-scale slots, so it does not matter that our
 * timestamps are hours apart — handed the bars alone, a 63-hour hole renders
 * as zero horizontal distance and the chart draws straight across it.
 * Measured on one real pool: 421 bars over 792 hours, 47% of the range
 * missing, in 43 runs, the longest 63 hours.
 *
 * That is precisely what this product refuses elsewhere and says so —
 * PriceLine's caption reads 'the hours the feed published nothing are left
 * out rather than drawn across, which is what the breaks are'. Whitespace
 * entries are the library's own mechanism for exactly this.
 *
 * It happens here rather than in the reader on purpose: the read returns
 * facts, the renderer decides spacing.
