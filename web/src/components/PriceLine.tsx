/**
 * The oracle's own series.
 *
 * NOT Sparkline, and the difference is why this file exists. Sparkline spaces
 * points by INDEX — x = i / (n - 1) — which is right for an equity curve sampled
 * on a fixed tick and wrong here: a session with twenty rounds would get twenty
 * times the width of one with a single round, and the shape would be an artefact
 * of how often the oracle felt like writing.
 *
 * A STRAIGHT REAL-TIME AXIS IS ALSO WRONG, and it was the first thing tried.
 * Measured on the AAPL feed: 400 rounds spanning 61 days drew 44 segments
 * covering 28% OF THE WIDTH, median segment three pixels. The feed runs 24/5 and
 * writes on deviation, so most of the calendar is silence, and a chart that
 * honours that literally is 72% empty and unreadable.
 *
 * So the axis is SESSION-COMPRESSED, the way every trading chart is: real
 * elapsed time inside a session, a fixed narrow gutter between them. Time within
 * a session is therefore true to scale, the breaks stay visible, and the hours
 * nobody published are not drawn as though they were. The caption says all of
 * this, because a compressed axis a reader has not been told about is the
 * dishonest version.
 *
 * Server-rendered SVG, like the sparkline: nothing here is interactive, and a
 * chart is not worth a hydration boundary on a phone.
