/**
 * WHO GOT IN, AND WHEN.
 *
 * The reference product plots trader avatars on a price line. This plots them
 * on a TIME line, and the difference is not a compromise — it is what the data
 * actually supports and, for a product whose subject is the agents, arguably
 * the better chart.
 *
 * AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT WAS WRONG, and it is worth recording how.
 * It said candles were IMPOSSIBLE for the 32-byte curve poolIds that cover most
 * of what is interesting on this chain, reasoning from GeckoPool.poolAddress
 * being null for them. That field is about CALLABILITY — somewhere to send an
 * eth_call — and the index indexes those pools perfectly well: asked directly,
 * /networks/robinhood/pools/<32-byte poolId>/ohlcv/hour returns 200 with real
 * candles.
 *
 * So the true statement is narrower. No OHLC exists in this repo yet, poolId is
 * not carried as far as the page, and nothing memoises a per-token candle
 * request on an index that refuses roughly two in five of them. This plot is
 * what the data supports TODAY, and it stays on the page beneath any chart that
 * later arrives — because it answers a question a candle chart cannot.
 *
 * The axis is labelled with what it plots. Nothing here implies a price.
