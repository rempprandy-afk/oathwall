/**
 * WHAT THE BROWSER IS ALLOWED TO ASK A THIRD PARTY, AND HOW IT ASKS.
 *
 * The redesign needed three outside feeds the app had never used — Robinhood's
 * issuer quotes, Yahoo's chart bars, Blockscout's holder list — and reached
 * them by adding wildcard `rewrites()` to next.config.mjs:
 *
 *     {source:"/robinhood/:path*", destination:"https://api.robinhood.com/rhj/:path*"}
 *     {source:"/yahoo/:path*",     destination:"https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/:path*"}
 *     {source:"/blockscout/:path*",destination:"https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/api/v2/:path*"}
 *
 * That is three problems in five lines, and the first is the serious one.
 *
 * 1. IT SENDS THE READER'S SESSION COOKIE TO THREE STRANGERS. The session is
 *    set `httpOnly, secure, sameSite:"strict", path:"/"` — `path:"/"` is what
 *    matters. `/yahoo/…` is same-origin, so the browser attaches the cookie,
 *    and a Next rewrite proxies the request upstream with its headers. Every
 *    chart view on a hosted deployment posted a live merrymen session to
 *    Yahoo. `sameSite:"strict"` does not help: this IS the site.
 *
 * 2. IT IS AN OPEN PROXY. `:path*` means anyone on the internet can drive our
 *    egress at those three hosts, through our IP and our reputation, at any
 *    path they choose, unauthenticated — the middleware's cross-site and host
 *    guards only cover `/api/`.
 *
 * 3. IT IS UNBOUNDED. No timeout, no size cap, no cache: every visitor's page
 *    load became ten upstream requests, re-fetched on every navigation.
 *
 * So the browser now asks OUR api, and this module is where the ask is bounded.
 * Requests upstream are BUILT, never forwarded: a fresh URL from validated
 * pieces, a fixed header set, no cookies, a timeout and a byte cap. The symbol
 * must be one this chain actually lists; the window must be one of five; the
 * address must be twenty bytes of hex. There is no arm that takes a caller's
 * string and puts it in a URL.
 *
 * `coin-image/route.ts` already argued all of this for logos, in 2026-08. This
 * is the same argument applied to data.
 *
 * PURE. No network here — the routes do the fetching, this decides what may be
 * fetched, so the decision can be tested without one.
