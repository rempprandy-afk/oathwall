/**
 * The grant binding — how the server decides an agent account is yours.
 *
 * This is the check that replaced `grant.owner === tenant`, which could never
 * hold: the owner key is minted in the browser, so it is never the signed-in
 * wallet, and requiring it refused every hosted grant ever submitted.
 *
 * The replacement is two signatures over one server-issued nonce, and the
 * second one is the whole point. With only the wallet's authorization the
 * server's remaining checks are functions of PUBLIC addresses — an attacker
 * signs in as themselves, names someone else's (owner, account) pair, and both
 * checks pass. That is account-id squatting relocated, not prevented, and every
 * ledger table keys on smart_account. The owner key's co-signature is what
 * makes the claim unforgeable, so the test that matters most here is the one
 * asserting a claim WITHOUT it is refused.
 *
 * Real viem signatures throughout, no mocks: the server recovers addresses the
 * same way production does.
