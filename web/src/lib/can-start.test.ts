 * This predicate decides whether an owner is shown the dashboard or held on the
 * fund step, so both directions of being wrong are expensive: hold a working
 * agent's owner and they conclude the product is broken; wave an unfunded one
 * through and they wait for trades that cannot happen.
 *
 * The unsponsored cases are pinned hardest. Sponsorship is off by default and
 * permanently off for any self-hosted install that has not opted in, so those
 * are the paths almost every user is on and they must not move at all.
