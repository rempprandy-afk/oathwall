/**
 * WITHDRAWING FROM THE BROWSER, because hosted there is nowhere else to do it.
 *
 * The server refuses `/api/recover` when hosted, correctly: it holds no owner
 * key, so it has nothing to sign with. Its comment said recovery "runs entirely
 * in the browser ... which the client already knows how to do" — and no such
 * client existed. This is it.
 *
 * NO NEW ENGINE. `planRecovery` and `recoverFunds` from the worker are the same
 * functions the CLI runs; they import only viem, @zerodev/* and packages/core,
 * with no node builtins, and the `@oathwall/recover` alias already existed. The
 * phone app has run this same module unmodified for months, so its portability
 * is demonstrated rather than hoped for.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT IN A BROWSER, and both are handled here.
 *
 * THE BUNDLER. Hosted, the Pimlico key is a house secret. `recoverFunds` takes
 * `bundlerUrl` as an opaque string, so it is pointed at this origin's relay,
 * which adds the key server-side and forwards only withdrawal-shaped traffic.
 * Reads need no relay at all: the chain's RPC answers browsers directly
 * (`access-control-allow-origin: *`, probed against 4663), so `rpcUrl` is left
 * undefined and viem uses the chain default.
 *
 * THE TOKEN LIST. `extraTokens` must NOT come from `/api/settings`: hosted, that
 * route returns `{}` to a caller with no session cookie, and the entire point of
 * this path is that it works signed out and after a kill. An empty list silently
 * falls back to the builtin set and leaves every owner-added token behind —
 * which is the exact failure `sweepList` was written to prevent. So it comes
 * from the grant in localStorage, which carries `grantTokens`: the addresses the
 * wall actually covers. `sweepList` re-validates every entry anyway.
