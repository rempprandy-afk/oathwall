/**
 * WHAT PRIVY IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE HERE.
 *
 * Two Privy features would quietly replace architecture oathwall already has,
 * and both are opt-in — which means the only thing standing between "not
 * enabled" and "enabled" is that nobody imported them. That is not a boundary,
 * it is an absence, so this file makes the absence a test.
 *
 *   SMART WALLETS. Privy can create its own ERC-4337 account. Oathwall already
 *   has Kernel v3.3, the permission wall, existing smart-account addresses and
 *   a bundler path. A second smart-account implementation beside them means two
 *   answers to "where are the funds", and the ledger keys on one of them.
 *
 *   SERVER-SIDE SIGNERS. Privy can be delegated authority to sign on a user's
 *   behalf from a backend. Oathwall's whole custody story is that the server is
 *   never custodian — the hosted grant intake returns 422 for a payload
 *   carrying key material. A delegated signer is that, with extra steps.
 *
 * And the secret boundary: PRIVY_APP_SECRET belongs to the web service alone.
 * Brain has no environment to receive it, worker children have it stripped at
 * fork, and it appears in no prompt, decision record or log line.
