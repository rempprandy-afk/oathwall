/**
 * WHAT IS MY AGENT DOING RIGHT NOW, AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
 *
 * A user with $318 in the account looked at the home screen and asked, in the
 * group chat, "Will it now start trading". The screen he was looking at led
 * with **Total equity**, then "— building today · no deposit on record yet",
 * then CASH / VAULT / POSITIONS, then a sentence about what the chain caps.
 * Every one of those is true, and not one of them answers his question.
 *
 * That is the gap this fills. The console is an accounting surface pointed at
 * somebody who wants a status. Both are worth having; the status has to come
 * first, because it is the question everyone actually arrives with.
 *
 * THREE RULES, and they are the whole design:
 *
 *  1. NO JARGON THAT ISN'T LOAD-BEARING. Not "equity", not "positions", not
 *     "session key", not the strategy's internal name. A person who has just
 *     sent money wants a sentence, not a vocabulary.
 *  2. NEVER CLAIM WHAT WE DID NOT CHECK. This file has no clock and no market
 *     calendar, so it never says "the market is closed" — it says what it can
 *     see. The codebase's central rule is that unknown is not representable as
 *     zero, and a status line is exactly where that rule gets bent for the sake
 *     of a comforting sentence.
 *  3. ALWAYS SAY WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. A status with no next step is a status
 *     someone has to come back and ask about, which is what happened here.
 *
 * Pure, so the wording is testable without a browser, a chain, or a ledger.

  // Before a sponsor is turned on, a gasless agent writes
  // "no ETH in the account — every operation fails…" on every tick it tries to
  // trade. Turn sponsorship on and the worker stops writing it — but it never
  // stops READING: the feed returns the last 40 events with no age filter, and a
  // now-sponsored account that is quiet writes nothing to push them out. So the
  // newest `err` stays that message forever, this branch sits above every gas
  // branch, and the dashboard tells a perfectly healthy sponsored agent's owner
  // that it has stopped and cannot start again — permanently, and while it
  // trades. Every sponsored sentence below would be unreachable.
  //
  // Narrow deliberately. It suppresses ONE message class, and only when a
  // sponsor is paying — which is exactly the condition that makes that message
  // false. Every other error, and every error at all when unsponsored, still
  // outranks everything: this branch exists because a fleet-wide outage went
