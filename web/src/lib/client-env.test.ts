/**
 * Server env vars do not exist in the browser bundle.
 *
 * This pins the defect that made hosted onboarding fail for every tester, in a
 * way that cannot come back. `isHostedMode()` reads `process.env.MERRYMEN_HOSTED`
 * (packages/core/src/hosted.ts). Next inlines only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the
 * client bundle, and web/next.config.mjs declares no `env` block — so in any
 * `"use client"` module that call evaluates to `false` no matter how the server
 * is configured.
 *
 * It did exactly that in web/src/lib/session.ts, which used it to decide whether
 * to strip the owner key before POSTing a grant. It never stripped it, the
 * server refused every hosted grant with a 422, and nothing surfaced the
 * refusal. The bug is invisible by construction: no type error, no runtime
 * throw, just a constant that is quietly always false.
 *
 * The client's only trustworthy signal is GET /api/auth/session, which returns
 * {hosted, address} at runtime.
 *
 * Route handlers under app/api are server-side (node runtime) and may use it
 * freely — that is where it belongs.
