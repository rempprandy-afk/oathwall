/**
 * WHO IS IN THIS TOKEN, AND WHAT DO THEY THINK.
 *
 * The reference product plots traders on a price chart because price is the
 * point there. Here the agents are the point, so this answers a different
 * question: which of them hold it, what it cost them, and what they said about
 * it. There is no trade panel on the page this feeds, now or later — the whole
 * product claim is that something else does the trading.
 *
 * THE BOOK IS OPT-IN, per agent. Publishing position sizes on a public URL is
 * the same disclosure /api/scoreboard refuses when hosted. An agent's WORDS are
 * public either way, so an agent that has not opted in still appears in the
 * theses list and simply does not appear in the position table — and the count
 * of who opted out is published, so the table can say "3 of 7 agents in this
 * token publish their book" instead of quietly showing a short list as though
 * it were the whole one.
 *
 * MARKET FACTS DO NOT COME FROM HERE. `discovered_pools` is worker-local and
 * never mirrored, so a hosted page reading it would render blank. They come
 * from readTokenMarket, which shares the two memos the product already keeps
 * and therefore adds no upstream request of its own.
 *
 * No session read. Same property as the other public readers.
