/**
 * The dashboard's read side of the ledger, behind the same driver seam the worker

 * READ-ONLY per request, so the worker stays the single writer and a corrupt or
 * locked file degrades to an empty panel rather than a 500. Hosted (DATABASE_URL)
 * reads the shared Postgres the worker child wrote — a pooled driver, opened once.
 *
 * Both backends speak the store's sqlite dialect; db.ts translates it for Postgres.
 * The one thing the web queries must avoid is a sqlite-only builtin the translator
 * doesn't cover — hence `datetime(at,'unixepoch')` is gone from the SQL here and
 * timestamps are formatted from the raw epoch by fmtEpoch() instead.
