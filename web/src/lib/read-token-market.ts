/**
 * WHAT THE MARKET SAYS ABOUT ONE TOKEN.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from read-token, which answers who HOLDS it. That file
 * reads the ledger; this one reads two indexes, and keeping them apart is what
 * lets the page render each half when only one of them answered.
 *
 * WHICH INDEX OWNS A TOKEN IS DECIDED OFFLINE. TRADABLE_TOKENS is a static list
 * compiled into the app, so "is this a listed token" costs no request
 * and cannot fail. Everything else on this chain is a coin, and coins live in
 * the GeckoTerminal read.
 *
 * NEITHER READ IS MADE FOR THIS PAGE. The stock side is the same fetchMarket
 * the tape and /tokens already share; the coin side goes through the
 * single-flight memo in read-discoveries. A token page therefore adds no
 * upstream request at all, which is the only affordable shape on a chain
 * returning 429s to this fleet.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NOT TWO. "The index says nothing trades here" and "the index
 * could not be asked" are different facts, and rendering the second as the
 * first states something false while looking completely normal. `read` carries
 * the difference and the page is expected to branch on it.
