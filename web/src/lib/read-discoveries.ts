/**
 * What is trading on this chain.
 *
 * READS THE INDEX, NOT THE LEDGER, and that is the whole design decision.
 * Every other panel here goes through `withReadDb` against the worker's
 * database — which works self-hosted and renders EMPTY on the hosted deploy,
 * because the orchestrator strips DATABASE_URL from each worker child, so the
 * child writes sqlite in its own container while this service reads a Postgres
 * nothing ever created the schema in. A discoveries panel built the same way
 * would be blank on app.merrymen.dev for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Fetching server-side instead means the panel shows the same thing to
 * everyone, hosted or not, with no database and no tenant scoping —
 * `discovered_pools` has no tenant column anyway. It is the same shape
 * /api/market already uses.
 *
 * ONE READER, ONE MEMO, EVERY CALLER. This lived inside the route handler,
 * which meant the only way to reach it was an HTTP request — so a server
 * component wanting the same facts had to fetch its own process over the
 * network and miss the single-flight memo entirely. On a chain already
 * refusing this fleet at ~442 rate-limit hits in five minutes, a second
 * upstream read for facts we are holding in memory is the expensive mistake.
 * The route below is now a thin GET over this.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A third party's claim about a market, used to decide what is
 * worth LOOKING at. It is not a recommendation, nothing here has been checked
 * against the chain, and the agent cannot act on any of it without the owner
 * adding the token in /settings and re-signing the grant.

 * 2026-09-06, page 1 of the three feeds yields about 25 distinct tokens of

 * clear it. The market was several times larger than the panel the whole time,
 * and nothing said so, because a truncated list and a small market render
 * identically.
 *
 * Breadth first — page 1 of every feed, then page 2 of every feed — because the
 * budget is shared and the walk WILL be cut off some of the time. Taken
 * depth-first that costs whole feeds, and the one it would cost is whichever
 * sits last in the list.

 * encodes are all about what a REFUSAL means, and a refusal is the one thing an
 * integration test cannot ask a third party for on demand.
