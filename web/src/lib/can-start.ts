/**
 * Can this agent actually begin trading?
 *
 * ONE DEFINITION, because there were already two and a third was about to be
 * written. `Console.tsx` and `settings/SetupChecklist.tsx` each carried a
 * private `hasGas` and each asked the same question of it, so the console could
 * admit an owner that the checklist went on reporting as unfinished forever.
 *
 * THE RULE CHANGED WHEN SPONSORSHIP ARRIVED. Holding ETH is no longer the only
 * way to be able to trade: a sponsored agent pays no gas from its own balance,
 * so an owner with USDG and zero ETH is not stuck — the old predicate simply had
 * no way to say that, and would have trapped them on the fund step permanently.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
 *
 *   1. It does not treat an UNREADABLE balance as a funded one. The status route
 *      collapses a failed chain read to "0" and has no channel to say "unread",
 *      so anything unparseable is false here. Being told to fund an account that
 *      is already funded wastes a minute; being told an unfunded account is
 *      ready wastes a day of wondering why nothing trades.
 *
 *   2. It does not decide anything about WITHDRAWAL. Sponsorship covers trading
 *      only — the recovery path pays its own way out of the balance it is
 *      sweeping — so "can start" is not "needs no ETH ever", and no caller may
 *      read it that way.
 *
 *   3. It does not guess at sponsorship. `gasSponsored` is reported by the
 *      worker, which is the only process that resolves it.
