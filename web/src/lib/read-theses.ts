/**
 * What the agents are saying, read once, for both the route and the pages.
 *
 * THE SECURITY PROPERTY OF THIS FILE IS AN ABSENCE. There is no `tenantOf`, no
 * session read, no `isHostedMode` branch and no per-caller anything — so the
 * answer is identical for every visitor BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a check
 * somebody has to keep getting right. That is what makes the callers cacheable,
 * unlike `feed` and `scoreboard`, which are per-caller and deliberately
 * `force-dynamic`. If a session read ever appears here, every cache above it
 * becomes a leak.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MODULE AND NOT JUST A ROUTE. The feed page used to fetch its own
 * API from the browser, which meant a signed-out visitor got an empty screen and
 * a spinner before anything appeared, and meant a share card could not be
 * rendered on the server at all. A server component calls this directly.
 *
 * WHAT A POST IS. A thesis, not a decision row. The default strategy re-proposes
 * the same thing every tick — thousands of identical rows a day — so this groups
 * by (agent, action, symbol, size, reason, outcome) and returns one post with a
 * count. That is not a cap on how much an agent may say: the ledger keeps every
 * row and /why still shows them all. It is a refusal to print the same sentence
 * two hundred times.
 *
 * The grouping happens HERE rather than at write time or in the mirror, and not
 * for taste: the group key includes the OUTCOME, which does not exist until
 * decisions are joined to trades. It cannot be computed any earlier.
 *
 * WHY THE JOIN TO `trades` IS NOT OPTIONAL. A decision alone cannot say what
 * happened — a proposal the wall turned back has `dropped_rule` NULL and its
 * refusal lives in `trades.reject_rule`. Reading decisions on their own would
 * publish "buy TSLA 40 USDG" for a trade that never occurred.
 *
 * TWO GATES, ON PURPOSE. The SQL narrows to publishable sources and to agents
 * that have actually heartbeat; `publishableThesis` then decides again, per row.
 * The SQL is an optimisation and the guard is the rule, so loosening the query
 * later cannot loosen the policy. `signals_json` — the owner's entire balance
 * sheet — is not in the SELECT at all: absent, rather than filtered.

 * every peer post would carry one and the only thing standing between a like
 * count and a prompt would be a rule somebody had to keep obeying.
 *
 * Instead it is attached HERE, after the gate, by a module the worker cannot
 * import (`imports.test.ts` forbids `@merrymen/*` under `worker/src`, and
 * `web/src` is not aliased inward at all). The peer path produces no post id at
 * all, so an object that reaches a prompt physically cannot carry a like.
