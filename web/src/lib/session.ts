/**
 * The permission wall — creating an agent account and granting it a scoped key.
 *
 * NO EXTERNAL WALLET OWNS THE FUNDS. The account's owner key is generated in
 * the browser — you create the wallet, back up its owner key, and fund the
 * account address. Hosted adds ONE wallet popup on top of that, and only to
 * link the account to your login (see step 5); the wallet never owns the
 * account and never signs a trade. The flow (all counterfactual — nothing is
 * deployed until the agent's first trade):
 *  1. A fresh OWNER keypair is generated → it's the Kernel account's sudo
 *     validator (ECDSA). The smart-account address derives from it.
 *  2. A fresh SESSION keypair is generated for the agent.
 *  3. The session key is wrapped in a permission validator whose policies are
 *     enforced BY THE ACCOUNT CONTRACT on every UserOp:
 *       - call policy: only approve(USDG→allowed targets) with capped amounts,
 *         only vault.deposit with capped assets, only the Rialto router
 *       - rate limit: bounded ops per day
 *       - timestamp: hard expiry
 *  4. The owner key signs the grant locally (no popup); the serialized grant is
 *     what the worker uses to act. Revocation = expiry (or nonce invalidation).
 *  5. HOSTED ONLY — the account is bound to the signed-in tenant by two
 *     signatures over one server-issued nonce: the wallet authorizes the pair
 *     (intent) and the owner key co-signs it (possession). Both personal_sign,
 *     so no chain switch is ever required. Without step 5 the server has no way
 *     to tell whose account this is, because `owner` is a key minted here and
 *     can never equal the signed-in wallet.
 *
 * WHERE THE KEYS ACTUALLY LIVE, on every deployment including hosted mainnet.
 *
 * Both private keys are kept in this browser's localStorage. That is not a
 * testnet demo caveat — it is the shipped arrangement, and :308 below makes
 * this key load-bearing for hosted custody and for client-side recovery.
 * Whoever holds the owner key controls the funds; the UI forces a backup
 * before funding for exactly that reason.
 *
 * This block used to say production owner keys live in a Turnkey TEE and
 * never touch a browser. No such thing is shipped — no dependency, no code
 * path, no vendor. README.md is accurate that TEE custody is on the roadmap.
 * The comment mattered because a TEE is precisely what someone would cite to
 * argue that server-side custody is already fine here. It is not. Drawdown breaker
 * is worker-enforced until the breaker contract ships (Phase 2).
