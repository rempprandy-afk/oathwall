/**
 * EVERY INTENT THIS LEDGER RECORDED IN THE LAST DAY, AND WHAT THE WALL DID
 * WITH IT.
 *
 * This feeds a picture, not a table, so it reads the fewest columns that can
 * possibly make one: when it happened, what became of it, and — when the wall
 * turned it back — which rule did the turning. `amount_usdg`, `agent_id`,
 * `tx_hash` and `user_op_hash` are ABSENT rather than filtered, the same
 * discipline read-theses.ts applies to `signals_json`. A graphic cannot leak a
 * column it never selected.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE PICTURE. merrymen is a boundary. Its most distinctive fact is
 * that agents are refused constantly and visibly — one live agent is sitting on
 * 1,225 refusals and zero fills — and the product already shipped that fact as
 * a button ("prove the wall") rendered as a list of grey rows. This draws it.
 *
 * NO SESSION READ. No `tenantOf`, no `isHostedMode`, no per-caller anything —
 * which is what keeps every caller cacheable, exactly as read-theses.ts
 * documents. If a session read ever appears here, the caches above it become
 * leaks.
