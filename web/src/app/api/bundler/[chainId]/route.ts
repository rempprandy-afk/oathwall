/**
 * THE RECOVERY RELAY — a withdrawal submit path, not a bundler proxy.
 *
 * Hosted, the browser can SIGN a withdrawal but cannot SUBMIT one: the Pimlico
 * key is a house secret, and `pimlicoBundlerUrl` and `pimlicoPaymasterUrl` are
 * the byte-identical string, so handing it to a browser would hand out
 * house-sponsored gas along with it. This route closes that gap by adding the
 * key server-side and forwarding only what a withdrawal needs.
 *
 * The engine needs no changes: `recoverFunds` takes `bundlerUrl` as an opaque
 * string, so the browser passes `${origin}/api/bundler/4663` and everything else
 * is the code the CLI already runs.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FOUR GATES, and the third is the one that matters
 *
 * 1. METHOD ALLOWLIST, deny by default. Seven methods, listed below.
 * 2. THE TICKET names WHOSE account may be relayed; `userOp.sender` must equal
 *    it. See recovery-ticket.ts for what that does and does not prove.
 * 3. THE OPERATION MUST BE A WITHDRAWAL. Validating method, sender, entryPoint
 *    and paymaster fields never looks at what the operation DOES — without
 *    isRecoveryShape, any ticket holder could push swaps, approvals or arbitrary
 *    contract calls through app.oathwall.dev as a free transaction service on
 *    the house's bundler account. This is the gate that makes the file's first
 *    sentence true.
 * 4. NO PAYMASTER, structurally. Recovery never uses one, so any op carrying
 *    paymaster fields is refused outright — which makes house sponsorship
 *    impossible on this path by construction rather than by policy.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* DONE HERE
 *
 * carriesOwnerKey is NOT run on this body, and that is not an oversight. Its
 * RAW_KEY pattern matches any bare 32-byte hex value anywhere in the payload,
 * and a userOpHash is exactly 0x + 64 hex — so every receipt poll would 4xx, the
 * sweep would succeed on chain, and the panel would report a failure on a
 * withdrawal that already moved the money. The stronger guard is the typed
 * schema below: the only accepted fields are a method string, a userOp with a
 * known key set, an entryPoint address and a 32-byte hash. There is no field an
 * owner key could ride in. carriesOwnerKey stays where it belongs, on grant
 * intake.
 *
 * THE UPSTREAM URL IS NEVER ECHOED. viem embeds the full request URL — query
 * string included — in its error metaMessages, which is precisely how a Pimlico
 * key leaks into an error toast. Failures are mapped to {code, message} and
 * scrubbed.

 * IS THERE ACTUALLY A PAYMASTER, or just a field set to zero?
 *
 * The first version refused any of these fields that was not undefined, null,
 * "0x" or "" — which is wrong, because a client with NO paymaster still emits
 * the gas-limit fields as `0x0`. A zero gas limit is not sponsorship; it is the
 * absence of it, spelled out. That refusal turned a perfectly good withdrawal
 * into a 403 and cost a user their first attempt.
 *
 * So each field is judged by what it actually means:
 *   paymaster            — an ADDRESS. Absent, or the zero address, means none.
 *   paymasterData        — BYTES. Empty means none.
 *   paymasterAndData     — the packed 0.6-era form. Empty means none.
 *   *GasLimit            — NUMBERS. Zero means none.
 *
 * The gate itself is unchanged in intent: any real paymaster is refused, so
 * house sponsorship stays impossible on this path by construction.
