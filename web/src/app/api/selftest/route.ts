/**
 * Ask the worker to run its pipeline probe, and report what came back.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `merrymen selftest` is a CLI flag, and hosted spawns the
 * worker without it (orchestrator.ts) — so the one command designed to answer
 * "can this agent actually transact" was unreachable for every hosted tenant.
 * That is how a fleet-wide arming failure stayed invisible for hours: the only
 * way to find out was to read container logs by hand.
 *
 * THE WEB PROCESS CANNOT RUN IT. The worker is a separate process — a separate
 * container, hosted — with no HTTP server and no IPC. So this enqueues and the
 * worker's tick drains. Everything the dashboard has ever told the worker has
 * gone through a store the other side polls; this is that pattern, not a new
 * transport.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. Not an order path. The only `kind` written here is a literal,
 * so a compromised session cannot use this to make the agent trade. When chat
 * orders land they go through the same channel with their own validation and
 * their own wall check — the channel is deliberately dumb.
