/**
 * MINT A RECOVERY TICKET — the anti-abuse token the bundler relay demands.
 *
 * GET  issues an origin-bound, single-use nonce.
 * POST takes a signature over the recovery challenge, recovers the owner
 *      ADDRESS, derives the Kernel account that owner controls, and returns a
 *      short-lived ticket bound to {smartAccount, chainId}.
 *
 * NO OWNER KEY CROSSES THE WIRE, and none can: the request body's only accepted
 * fields are a nonce, a 65-byte signature and a chain id. The signature is over
 * a message that says in words that it moves no funds, and the server can do
 * nothing with it except recover an address.
 *
 * WHY NOT REQUIRE A SESSION. Because the recoveries that matter most have none.
 * The kill switch DELETEs the tenant's grants row, so after a kill the server no
 * longer knows the account at all — and "I killed my agent, now I want my money"
 * is the likeliest reason anyone opens recovery. A session requirement would
 * refuse exactly those people. It also has to work for superseded wallets and
 * from a browser that was never signed in.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PROVE: that the account has ever existed on
 * this deployment. A stranger can generate keypairs in a loop and mint tickets
 * for accounts nobody has funded. That is why the relay tiers its quota on
 * whether we have actually SEEN the account rather than trusting the ticket
 * alone — the ticket bounds WHOSE operation may be relayed, not how much of the
 * house's bundler allowance a stranger may spend.
