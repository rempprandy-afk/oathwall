/**
 * Recover funds — the dashboard's "get my money out" endpoint.
 *
 * The funded address is a counterfactual ERC-4337 smart account; its owner key
 * controls it but derives a DIFFERENT address, and after a kill the session key
 * is gone. This rebuilds the account from the OWNER key (sudo) and sweeps every
 * balance to an address the user controls — the same engine `oathwall recover`
 * runs on the CLI (worker/src/recover.ts), reused here so there's one code path.
 *
 * Key handling: for an active grant the owner key is read from ~/.oathwall/
 * grant.json and NEVER leaves the server. For a killed/expired agent (no grant
 * file) the user pastes their backed-up key; it reaches only this localhost
 * route, is used to sign one op, and is never logged or echoed back. The bundler
 * key stays server-side in both cases. The dashboard binds to 127.0.0.1.
 *
 *   GET             → recovery context for the active grant (balances, bundler?)
 *   POST {mode:plan}→ rebuild from a key (stored or pasted) and read balances
 *   POST {mode:sweep, to} → sign + submit the sweep, return the tx hash
