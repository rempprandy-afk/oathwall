/**
 * WHAT YOUR AGENT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TRADE.
 *
 * THE CIRCULARITY THIS BREAKS. A discovered coin is unpriceable because it is
 * not watched, and it cannot be watched until somebody adds it by hand — three
 * steps across two screens plus a re-sign. So the scout finds coins every ten
 * minutes and every one of them dies at the wall as `asset-allowlist`, and the
 * owner never learns that the fix was theirs to make.
 *
 * This route is the agent's half of it: the coins it has actually vetted, with
 * its own reason, that THIS owner's signature does not yet cover. The owner's
 * half is one action — see the approve flow in the terminal.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS TRUE HERE, AND WHAT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLAIM ───────────────────
 *
 * SYMBOL AND DECIMALS ARE READ FROM THE CONTRACT, never from the index.
 * `DiscoveryRow.name` is the index's label and read-discoveries says so
 * verbatim: "attacker-chosen and could impersonate a real ticker". A symbol is
 * about to be shown to a person AND written into a signed policy allowlist, so
 * it comes from the token's own `symbol()`, sanitised to the charset
 * `isValidCustomToken` will accept. `discovery.ts` states the same rule for the
 * same reason; this is that rule, applied at the point a human decides.
 *
 * PER-CALLER, because "does your grant already cover this" is a question about
 * one tenant. So: `force-dynamic`, no cache, `tenantOf` first. The expensive
 * half — the discovery sweep and the scout's verdicts — is the house-wide
 * memoised read every viewer already shares, so a caller costs a grant read and
 * at most a few `symbol`/`decimals` calls.
 *
 * IT PROPOSES; IT DOES NOT DECIDE. Nothing here writes settings, touches a
 * grant, or widens anything. It returns a list and the reasoning behind it.
