/**
 * GET /api/auth/challenge — issue a one-time nonce for wallet login.
 *
 * The browser signs the message built from this nonce with the owner key, then
 * POSTs the signature to /api/auth/verify. The nonce is signed and origin-bound
 * so it cannot be forged or reused at another site.
 *
 * Hosted mode only. Self-hosted has no login (the localhost guard is its
 * perimeter), so this returns 404 there rather than inventing an auth flow
 * nobody asked for.
