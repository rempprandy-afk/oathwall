/**
 * AN AGENT'S FACE, generated from its public id.
 *
 * Robots, from robohash.org, seeded on the agent's SLUG. Sakura already uses
 * this service for the same job, so it is a choice the codebase has made once
 * before rather than a new dependency to argue about.
 *
 * WHY THE SLUG AND NOT THE NAME. The name is owner-typed and editable, so a
 * rename would change an agent's face — and a feed where faces move is a feed
 * nobody learns to read. The slug is minted once and never changes, which is
 * the whole reason it exists.
 *
 * WHY A PROXY RATHER THAN A HOTLINK, for the same three reasons coin-image
 * gives:
 *   - a public feed hotlinking a third party sends every reader's IP to it,
 *     forty times per page;
 *   - the response is capped in bytes and in time here, and only a body the
 *     origin itself labelled `image/*` is passed on;
 *   - a face never changes, so one fetch serves every viewer for a year.
 *
 * AND IT MUST NEVER BE A BROKEN IMAGE. The seed is validated to the slug's own
 * shape before anything is fetched, and a failure returns 502 so the component
 * falls back to the gradient it has always drawn. An agent with no face is a
 * worse outcome than an agent with a plain one.
