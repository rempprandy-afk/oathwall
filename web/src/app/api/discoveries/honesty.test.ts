/**
 * A FAILED READ MUST NOT BECOME A CLAIM ABOUT A COIN.
 *
 * The bug these pin, written down because it shipped and the owner screenshotted
 * it. The three enrichment reads fail as a wave — the RPC refuses the burst and
 * readTokenMeta, readCardFacts and readBlockClock all come back empty at the
 * same instant — and the route rendered that as `bare: m ? m.bare : true`. So
 * every card asserted "Published nothing about itself" and "no socials" about
 * coins that had published plenty, alongside a blank ticker and "— old".
 *
 * `readTokenMeta` returns a MAP specifically so a caller can tell "read and
 * empty" from "not read" — its own docstring says so — and the route threw that
 * distinction away one file away from where the same mistake had just been fixed
 * for the market index. That makes three times in this codebase that "could not
 * ask" was rendered as "nothing there", which is why it is now a test.

// Most of this was one file. The read moved to lib/read-discoveries so a server
// component could share its single-flight memo instead of fetching this process
// over the network, which left the cache-control behaviour here and everything
// else there. The properties below are about the discoveries read AS A WHOLE,
// so the whole is what they read — splitting them across two constants would
// mean deciding, per assertion, which half is allowed to satisfy it, and the
// first one filed under the wrong half would pass by accident forever.
