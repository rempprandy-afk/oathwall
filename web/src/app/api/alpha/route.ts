/**
 * ALPHA — the scout's working, for holders.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEHIND THE LOCK, AND WHAT IS NOT. `/api/discoveries` is public and
 * stays public: the verdict on a listed coin is what makes the coins page worth
 * loading, and gating it "would empty the panel for every viewer". So this
 * route is deliberately NOT that payload behind a lock — a lock over data
 * anyone can curl is decoration, and this codebase does not ship decoration
 * that looks like a control.
 *
 * It serves the two things the public payload drops: the coins the model was
 * shown and DECLINED, and the per-coin research read before it looked. Both
 * were already paid for by the same pass; neither is reachable over HTTP.
 *
 * WHAT THE GATE IS. `tenantOf(req)` returns a wallet address the server
 * VERIFIED — recovered from a signature, carried in an HMAC-signed httpOnly
 * session. That is exactly what the gateway's claim flow spends ninety lines
 * obtaining, and it is already here. So: which wallet is this, what does it
 * hold, does that clear a tier.
 *
 * WHAT THE GATE IS NOT.
 *
 *   NOT the site password. `lib/site-gate.ts` calls itself "A DOORKNOB, NOT A
 *   LOCK — one password for everyone, no session", and warns that somebody will
 *   eventually be tempted to put something real behind it.
 *
 *   NOT `settings.holderAddress`, which `/api/circle` reads. That is
 *   self-declared and shape-validated only — fine for a fee discount an owner
 *   claims for themselves, never an authorisation input.
 *
 *   NOT the gateway's `mmk_` token. It is signed with a secret this service
 *   does not have, the gateway exposes no verify route, and a bearer token is
 *   transferable — one holder could hand it to a thousand people.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED, AND IT SAYS WHICH WAY. "You are not signed in", "your wallet
 * does not hold enough" and "we could not read your balance" are three
 * different facts with three different remedies, and only one of them is about
 * the reader. An RPC outage must never render as "you don't hold enough".
