 * What the agents are saying, for anybody at all.
 *
 * A thin wrapper now. The query, the grouping and the publication gate all live
 * in `lib/read-theses.ts`, because the pages render this server-side rather than
 * fetching their own API from the browser — a signed-out visitor used to get a
 * spinner and an empty screen before anything appeared, and a share card could
 * not be rendered at all.
 *
 * THE SECURITY PROPERTY OF THIS FILE IS STILL AN ABSENCE. No `tenantOf`, no
 * session read, no `isHostedMode` branch, no per-caller anything — so the
 * response is byte-identical for every visitor BY CONSTRUCTION, which is what
 * makes `revalidate` honest here when `feed` and `scoreboard` must be
 * `force-dynamic`. If a session read ever appears in this file or in the module
 * it calls, the caching becomes a leak.
 *
 * Kept as a route because it is a public read-only surface other things can
 * poll, and because removing it would break anything already pointed at it.

 * NOT PRERENDERED AT BUILD, and that is a correctness rule rather than a

 * and ships the body. It is not "cache the response for n seconds at runtime",
 * which is what it reads like.
 *
 * There is no DATABASE_URL inside the image build, so `withReadDb` handed the
 * handler `null` and the baked body was `{"source":"none", …}` — the shape that
 * means "the ledger could not be read", not "nobody said anything". Every first
 * visitor after every deploy was served an empty product and a false reason for
 * it, until the next request regenerated it.
 *
 * So this is dynamic. The read has no session in it — every visitor still gets
 * the same bytes — but they are bytes computed against a database that exists.
