/**
 * What is launching, and what is trading.
 *
 * A client component because /api/discoveries is `force-dynamic` behind an
 * in-process single-flight memo — it does live index and on-chain reads, and
 * the page must not block a server render on them.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE TWO EMPTY STATES IS LOAD-BEARING and pinned by
 * api/discoveries/honesty.test.ts. The quiet-launchpad sentence is a confident
 * claim about a venue that runs at hundreds of launches an hour, and it may
 * only be made when the launch scan actually SUCCEEDED. So the unreadable case
 * is checked first, always.
 *
 * (That test compares source positions, so this comment deliberately does not
 * quote the sentence itself — doing so put a match above the code and failed
 * the check it was describing.)
