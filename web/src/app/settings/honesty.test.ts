/**
 * WHAT /settings MUST STILL DO AFTER IT IS RESTYLED.
 *
 * This file exists BEFORE the migration, not after it, and that ordering is the
 * whole point. A sibling investigation proved by mutation that seventeen
 * separate regressions to the grant and settings flows pass this repo's entire
 * suite — including deleting an RCE warning, unbinding a hosted provider filter
 * that exists to stop SSRF, and putting a redacted secret into an editable
 * input. Every one of those survives a class rename with the strings intact,
 * because nothing asserted the WIRING.
 *
 * A restyle touches roughly forty class names across 1,359 lines. The review
 * surface is far too large to eyeball, so the properties are written down first
 * and the diff is measured against them.
 *
 * Source scans, in the idiom of app/(app)/t/[token]/honesty.test.ts: these are
 * properties of how the page is WRITTEN, and a render test passes on a branch
 * that never fired.
