/**
 * WHAT THE TERMINAL IS ALLOWED TO SAY HAPPENED.
 *
 * The redesign moved every screen in the product into `web/src/terminal` and
 * left the components that carried the old disclosures behind, unmounted. The
 * invariants those components protected did not move with them, so this file
 * re-pins the four that were being violated on live surfaces:
 *
 *   a decision nothing came of is not a trade
 *   a trade the chain has not confirmed is not a fill
 *   an unreadable ledger is not a quiet one
 *   a growth curve is not raw equity, and not one drawn over inferred deposits
 *
 * Each is written the way this repo writes them: the smallest possible unit
 * check where the logic is pure, and a source read where the property lives in
 * a render. A source read is not a fashion here — it is the only way to test a
 * claim that is made in words on a screen.
