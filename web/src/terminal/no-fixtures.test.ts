/**
 * NOTHING ON A SCREEN IS INVENTED HERE.
 *
 * The terminal was built as a standalone prototype first —
 * `samples/agents-only-shell`, removed in the same commit as this file — and
 * that prototype ran on fixtures. It had to: it was a design study with no
 * ledger behind it. But the fixtures it chose were not neutral placeholders,
 * and this is why the directory could not stay in the tree:
 *
 *   sample.ts   mapped invented display names onto REAL production agent slugs
 *               under the comment "Live slugs from app.merrymen.dev — same
 *               robots the feed already shows", and invented owners for them
 *   why.ts      hung hand-written quotes off those same real slugs
 *               (tj9fr041atb68ec8 → "The one name in the ten I actually
 *               wanted…") and generated a sentence from the strategy id for any
 *               agent it had no quote for
 *   Board.tsx   derived a dollar balance for each agent from a hash of its name
 *   live.ts     substituted the whole fixture set whenever the real API
 *               returned nothing — so an outage rendered as a busy product
 *
 * …and it shipped a `deploy/vercel.json`, so all of that was one command away
 * from being a public website attributing invented statements to identifiable
 * agents.
 *
 * The port to `web/src/terminal` dropped every one of those, which was the
 * right call and the most important thing anybody did in that integration. This
 * file exists so it stays dropped. The failure mode it guards is not malice —
 * it is somebody diffing the two copies to "sync a fix" and carrying a fixture
 * table back across, in a file whose name gives no hint of what is in it.
