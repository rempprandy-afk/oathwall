/**
 * THE TERMINAL'S NUMBERS, AND THE ONE RULE THEY ALL SHARE.
 *
 * 29,000 lines of new interface arrived with no tests. These are the pure
 * functions underneath it — the ones that turn a number, or the absence of one,
 * into what a person reads. They are where this product's defining property
 * lives or dies, because the property is not "the maths is right", it is:
 *
 *     A BALANCE OF ZERO AND A FIGURE WE COULD NOT FETCH ARE DIFFERENT FACTS
 *     AND MUST NEVER RENDER THE SAME.
 *
 * "$0.00" is a statement about an account. "—" is a statement about us. A
 * formatter that turns null into 0 erases the second and replaces it with a
 * confident version of the first, and nothing downstream can recover the
 * difference — which is why it is tested here, at the only place it is still
 * visible.
 *
 * The colour rule is the same rule wearing different clothes, and it is the one
 * that actually shipped broken: every change column read
 * `(n ?? 0) < 0 ? "down" : "up"`, so a change we could not read printed "—" in
 * text and green in colour. On a table of twenty-five tokens colour is what a
 * reader takes in first, and green is a claim.
