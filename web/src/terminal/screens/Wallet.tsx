/**
 * VERIFY AN ADAPTER ADDRESS BEFORE IT IS SEALED, not after.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT PARANOIA. Sealing an adapter does two things, and the second
 * is easy to miss: `allowedSpenders()` appends the address to the spender ONE_OF
 * of EVERY approve permission in the grant (packages/core/src/wall.ts), and the
 * non-USDG approves pass `null` as the amount condition — which wall.ts itself
 * calls "a standing licence to move every share the agent holds". So one wrong
 * or stale value typed into one dashboard field becomes an unbounded pull target
 * across the whole token book, sealed into a signature, unseen.
 *
 * The worker already checks this — and too late. Its `eth_getCode` gate runs at
 * ARM time, which is after the owner has signed, after the grant is stored, and
 * after the only cheap moment to say no has passed. The cost of catching it
 * there is a wasted re-sign; the cost of not catching it at all is the paragraph
 * above.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS, because they fail differently:
 *   1. code exists at the address on THIS chain — catches a typo, an address
 *      from the other chain, an EOA pasted by mistake, and a contract that was
 *      never actually deployed;
 *   2. the code answers the shape we expect — `tradeExactIn` is present. Catches
 *      a real, live, wrong contract, which check 1 waves straight through. The
 *      deploy script performs the same ABI check for the same reason.
 *
 * REFUSES RATHER THAN SEALING SOMETHING UNVERIFIED. Returning `undefined` on
 * failure would mint a grant with no curve route, quietly — the owner would
 * think they had sealed it and find out at the first trade. Throwing puts the
 * failure where the owner is already looking.

              key. That mattered once the wall changed: a key signed earlier carries permissions a
              key signed today does not, both are valid, and the only way to tell them apart was to
              read the JSON. Capability drift you cannot see is capability drift you cannot act on.

              RE-SIGN ON PURPOSE, not only when the key is nearly dead.

              The only renewal button lived inside the expiry notice, which
              returns null unless the key has under three days left. So an owner
              who wanted to re-sign a HEALTHY key — the exact thing the panel
              above tells them to do, twice, with the words "renew below" — had
              no button to press. The routes that did work were: wait for it to
              nearly expire, add a token it does not cover, or go through a flow
              labelled "switch to another wallet" and paste the owner key back in.

              That gap has a cost beyond awkwardness. The wall changes: a policy
              contract turned out to be undeployed on this chain, and every key
              signed before that fix carries a pointer into empty space. Fixing
              the wall does nothing for a key already signed — re-signing is the
              only remedy, and it was the one thing the page would not let you do.

              Caps are editable here on purpose. They are sealed into the
              signature, so this is the only moment they can change, and offering
              a re-sign that silently keeps the old numbers would send owners
              back through the side door for the other half of the job.

              below are sealed into the signature too, so this is the moment to change them; the old

                    MOVING A KEY BETWEEN CHAINS, as a first-class action.

                    Testnet cannot trade anything. Every token and router address
                    merrymen knows is a mainnet-4663 deployment (preflight.ts's
                    chain guard says so in as many words), so a grant on 46630 is
                    a rehearsal that can never become a performance. The only way
                    off it was a control labelled "switch to another wallet",
                    which is where the chain picker happens to live — a new user
                    on a faucet asked "how to do leave testnet?" and could not
                    find it, because nothing on the page is called that.

                    Deliberately NOT a silent default. The mount effect pins the
                    selector to the loaded grant precisely so a mainnet owner
                    cannot click renew and land on the sandbox; this keeps that
                    property by making the move an explicit, acknowledged choice
                    with its own button, rather than a selector that could drift.
