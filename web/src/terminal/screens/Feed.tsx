/**
 * THE FEED, AND THE FILTER THAT STOPPED BEING A DRAWER.
 *
 * What was here: a modal sheet behind an icon, with eight topic checkboxes and
 * an asset-type dropdown — a filter UI a person had to open, read and configure
 * before it did anything, on the screen the owner calls the main tab. Nobody
 * opens a drawer to find out what is on a feed.
 *
 * What replaced it: the owner's own five pills, always visible, one tap each —
 * All · Trades · Theses · Debate · Top. `Top` is only rendered where likes
 * actually exist: on a self-hosted install there is nobody to attribute one to,
 * and a pill that can never fill is exactly the "button with no value" this
 * redesign is removing.
 *
 * The eight topics are not mourned. "Price spikes", "Profit milestones" and
 * "New traders" were derived filters over the same rows, invisible behind two
 * taps, and none of them answered the question a reader actually arrives with:
 * what did the agents do, and what did they say about it.
