/**
 * THE ONE MOUNT POINT.
 *
 * `(app)/layout.tsx` renders the terminal and nothing else — every route body
 * under `(app)/` is `return null` — so wrapping it here puts every screen
 * inside the provider with one edit. The layout stays a SERVER component: a
 * server component may import a client module and pass a client element as
 * children, so no `"use client"` spreads upward.
 *
 * Deliberately not inside `App.tsx`: App's own body owns the account state and
 * the `/api/auth/session` poll, and it is that body which needs `usePrivy()`.
 * Deliberately not in `app/layout.tsx`: that would load Privy onto `/gate`,
 * whose whole design point is that it fetches nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and provable by grep:
 *   - `@privy-io/react-auth/smart-wallets`, `SmartWalletsProvider`,
 *     `useSmartWallets` — merrymen already has Kernel v3.3, ERC-4337 and the
 *     permission wall. A second smart-account implementation beside them is the
 *     thing this integration was scoped to avoid.
 *   - `useSigners`, `addSigners`, `useSessionSigners`, `delegateWallet` — server
 *     side signing would put a key merrymen does not hold in a place merrymen
 *     cannot audit.
 * `privy-boundary.test.ts` asserts both, plus that `permissionless` is not even
 * installed.
