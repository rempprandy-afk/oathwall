/**
 * A STYLESHEET THAT CLAIMS TO BE SCOPED MUST ACTUALLY BE.
 *
 * console.css opens with "every rule is scoped under .sc-root". It was wrong
 * about thirty selectors, in two blocks, and nothing caught it — CSS has no
 * build error for a rule that is broader than its author intended. The leak had
 * two consequences and the second was worse than the first: those rules applied
 * on /grant, which also loads console.css; and they resolved --border, --bg-2,
 * --green from globals.css's :root while sitting in a sheet whose own palette
 * is --line/--panel/--mint, so four blocks of the console rendered in the OLD
 * terminal palette inside the new one, and deleting a globals token would have
 * broken them silently.
 *
 * So the new sheets state their prefix and this test enforces it. The repo
 * already works this way — client-env, honesty, imports and identity are all
 * tests that pin a property a reviewer would otherwise have to remember.
