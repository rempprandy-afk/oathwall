/**
 * Stage the merrymen package for bundling — as real files, not a symlink.
 *
 * Run `node stage-bundle.mjs` before electron-builder, `--restore` after.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL. desktop/package.json depends on `merrymen` as
 * `file:..`, which npm resolves to a SYMLINK back at the repo root.
 * electron-builder follows it and copies that entire tree — .gitignore included,
 * because it has no reason to read one. Worse, `!node_modules/merrymen/**`
 * negations DO NOT apply inside a symlinked package: I added seven of them and
 * the rebuilt bundle still contained every directory they named. They fail
 * silently, which is how this survived six releases. Two things shipped:
 *
 *   THE INSTALLER ATE ITSELF. desktop/dist holds previously built installers,
 *   so every release packaged the last one. 0.1.6 shipped at 260MB carrying
 *   0.1.5 inside it; 0.1.7 first built at 520MB. It doubles per release.
 *
 *   PRIVATE STATE WAS IN THE BUNDLE. .data/ is gitignored precisely because it
 *   holds local worker state — settings.json with API keys, the trade database.
 *   It was empty on this machine, so nothing leaked. On a machine that had ever
 *   run with MERRYMEN_HOME pointing at the repo, a public installer would have
 *   carried that owner's keys to everyone who downloaded it.
 *
 * THE FIX REUSES THE ALLOWLIST WE ALREADY MAINTAIN. `npm pack` honours the root
 * package.json `files` field — the same list that decides what goes to npm,
 * already reviewed, covering cli/web/worker/packages/strategies and nothing
 * else. Extracting that tarball over the symlink gives electron-builder plain
 * files it cannot over-collect. No second exclusion list to drift out of sync,
 * and a new top-level directory can't sneak in: to reach an installer it must
 * first be something we deliberately publish.
 *
 * The one thing the tarball lacks is merrymen's own node_modules (next, tsx,
 * viem) — npm never packs dependencies. Those come back as a junction to the
 * repo's node_modules, which electron-builder dereferences exactly as it did
 * the original symlink. Same bytes as before for the parts that matter.
