 *   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-v4selfswap.ts --network robinhood
 *
 * The two runs produce two DIFFERENT addresses (independent nonces per chain).
 * Paste each into /settings as `v4AdapterAddress` on the machine that signs
 * grants for that chain, then RE-SIGN the grant — the address is sealed into
 * the signature, so the setting alone changes nothing.
