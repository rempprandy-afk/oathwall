/**
 * Deploy PonsSelfTrade — the contract that makes a Pons bonding curve
 * constrainable by the permission wall.
 *
 * RUN BY THE OWNER, deliberately. Deployment spends real gas from a real key,
 * and this repo's agent never handles owner keys or moves funds on its own.
 * The key is read from the environment by hardhat.config.ts and is never
 * logged, written, or echoed by this script — only the ADDRESS it derives to.
 *
 *   $env:MERRYMEN_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY = "0x…"   # shell-only; close it after
 *   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-ponsselftrade.ts --network bnbTestnet
 *   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-ponsselftrade.ts --network robinhood
 *
 * The two runs produce two DIFFERENT addresses (independent nonces per chain).
 * Paste each into /settings as `ponsAdapterAddress` on the machine that signs
 * grants for that chain, then RE-SIGN the grant — the address is sealed into
 * the signature, so the setting alone changes nothing.
 *
 * NO CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS, and that is worth noticing rather than glossing.
 * V4SelfSwap pins its PoolManager as an immutable because there is exactly one
 * singleton to trust. There is no equivalent here: a Pons buy goes to a
 * per-token curve, ~475 new addresses an hour, so the curve is a call argument
 * and the contract cannot pin anything. That is stated in the contract header
 * and in the wall's permission, and it means this script has one less thing to
 * verify — and the deployment one less thing to get wrong.
