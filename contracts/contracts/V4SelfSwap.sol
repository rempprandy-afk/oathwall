/**
 * @title V4SelfSwap
 * @notice A Uniswap v4 spot swap that CANNOT send the output anywhere but back
 * to the caller. That single hardcoded word is the entire product.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. merrymen's agent is a Kernel smart account whose session key
 * is bounded by an on-chain call policy — "the wall" (packages/core/src/wall.ts).
 * A call policy can pin a target, a selector, and individual DECLARED ABI
 * arguments. The only v4 route on this chain is Permit2 + UniversalRouter, and
 * `execute(bytes commands, bytes[] inputs)` hides the swap recipient inside
 * opaque bytes, so the wall cannot say where the money goes. Granting it means
 * granting "move every approved token to any address, in one UserOp" — which is
 * why `allowUniswapV4` is hardcoded false in both signers and the agent cannot
 * buy or sell anything that only lives on v4.
 *
 * The fix is not a cleverer policy. It is to remove the recipient from the
 * calldata altogether. Here the output is taken to `msg.sender`, written in
 * Solidity, and `msg.sender` IS the smart account. There is no recipient
 * argument to constrain, mis-offset, or forget. Permit2 and the UniversalRouter
 * drop out of the wall entirely — a NET REDUCTION in granted power, not a
 * widening.
 *
 * THE ONE INVARIANT EVERYTHING ELSE RESTS ON:
 *   tokens are pulled ONLY from `msg.sender`, and paid ONLY to `msg.sender`.
 * Both addresses are the same local variable, captured once in `swapExactIn`
 * and carried into the callback. There is no code path that names a third
 * party. So an allowance granted to this contract can be spent by nobody but
 * the account that granted it, and one caller's bug can never reach another
 * caller's balance.
 *
 * SHAPE OF THE SIGNATURE, AND WHY IT IS FLAT. `swapExactIn` takes eight STATIC
 * words and no structs or `bytes`. The wall maps args[i] to calldata offset
 * i*32 with a flat positional rule and no ABI arity check (see zerodev's
 * permissions package, callPolicyUtils, `offset: i * 32`), so an all-static
 * signature makes the policy's view of the calldata and the ABI's view the same
 * thing by construction. wall.ts already carries a paragraph explaining why
 * `exactInputSingle`'s recipient is at word 3 while `exactInput`'s is at word 2
 * — a dynamic tuple moved it. Nothing here can move: no pointers exist. Every
 * word is also SEMANTIC, so the owner chooses how tight the wall is without
 * anyone touching this contract again:
 *
 *   word 0  tokenIn        ONE_OF an allowlist, or leave open
 *   word 1  tokenOut       EQUAL USDG makes this an EXIT-ONLY adapter
 *   word 2  fee            EQUAL a tier, or leave open
 *   word 3  tickSpacing    "
 *   word 4  hooks          EQUAL address(0) = hookless pools only (recommended)
 *   word 5  amountIn       LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL a per-trade cap
 *   word 6  minAmountOut   nothing useful — denominated in the output token
 *   word 7  deadline       nothing useful
 *
 * `zeroForOne` is deliberately NOT a parameter. It is derived from
 * `tokenIn < tokenOut`, because a bool whose meaning flips with the pool key is
 * a word no policy can say anything true about, and a caller-supplied direction
 * that disagrees with the key is a whole bug class that simply does not exist
 * here.
 *
 * Threat model (documented honestly):
 *
 * - THIS CONTRACT DOES NOT MAKE v4 SAFE. It makes v4 exactly as safe as the v3
 *   route the wall already grants, which is the bar that unblocks the flag and
 *   no higher. A compromised session key can still swap up to the standing
 *   ERC-20 allowance into a pool the attacker owns, at a price the attacker
 *   picks (`minAmountOut` is theirs to set to 1), and harvest the difference as
 *   the LP on the other side. Identical to what `exactInputSingle` already
 *   permits on SwapRouter02 today. What it costs the attacker is that they must
 *   put real capital in a pool and take the other side; what it costs the owner
 *   is bounded per call by the approve cap and per day by the grant's rate-limit
 *   policy. It is NOT zero. Do not let anyone tell the owner "the chain enforces
 *   it" and mean "you cannot lose money".
 *
 * - NO OWNER, NO ADMIN, NO PAUSE, NO UPGRADE. If there is a bug in here, nobody
 *   can stop it — including us. That is a deliberate trade: the alternative is
 *   an admin key that can pause the owner's exits, which is a worse failure in a
 *   contract standing between an agent and its only sell route. The mitigation
 *   is that a bug has almost nothing to work with: no storage, no balances, and
 *   no path that names an address other than `msg.sender`.
 *
 * - IT NEVER HOLDS TOKENS. Input goes straight from the caller to the
 *   PoolManager; output goes straight from the PoolManager to the caller. The
 *   contract's balance is zero before and after every call, so there is nothing
 *   here to steal even mid-transaction. There is deliberately NO rescue or sweep
 *   function: a rescue function is a "send tokens to an address" function, and
 *   this contract's whole value is that it does not have one. Anything
 *   accidentally transferred in is stuck forever. It is also unusable — the
 *   settle path pulls from the caller, never from this contract's balance — so
 *   a donation cannot subsidise anyone's swap.
 *
 * - NATIVE ETH IS REFUSED. `swapExactIn` is non-payable and both currencies must
 *   be contracts, so the wall's permission can carry `valueLimit: 0`. The cost is
 *   real: this cannot touch v4's native ETH/USDG pool. WETH pools on v3 remain
 *   the ETH route. Supporting native would mean a payable function, a non-zero
 *   valueLimit, and an ETH send back to the caller — three new things for one
 *   pool.
 *
 * - HOOKS ARE PASSED THROUGH, NOT TRUSTED. `hooks` is a caller-supplied address
 *   and a malicious hook can move the swap's deltas around during the callback.
 *   Two checks bound it: the amount pulled is whatever the DELTA says is owed and
 *   must be `<= amountIn` (so a hook cannot inflate the pull to drain a standing
 *   allowance), and the amount received must be `>= minAmountOut`. Belt and
 *   braces on top of that: the wall's recommended default pins `hooks` to
 *   address(0), because the worker can only DISCOVER hookless pools today
 *   (worker/src/venues/uniswap-v4.ts guesses keys across V4_TIERS), and granting
 *   reach the worker cannot use is exactly the "an unused router in this list is
 *   a standing licence" mistake wall.ts warns about.
 *
 * - PARTIAL FILLS ARE REAL. `sqrtPriceLimitX96` is set to the permissive bound,
 *   so a pool that runs out of liquidity fills less than `amountIn` and the swap
 *   succeeds. That is why every amount below comes from the returned delta and
 *   never from the argument: settling `amountIn` when the pool only took part of
 *   it would over-pay the pool by the difference.
 *
 * - FEE-ON-TRANSFER TOKENS DO NOT WORK. `settle()` credits what actually
 *   arrived; if a token skims the transfer, the debt is not cleared and the
 *   PoolManager reverts the whole unlock with CurrencyNotSettled. It fails
 *   closed, loudly, every time — it just never works.
 *
 * - TRANSIENT STORAGE. The re-entrancy flag uses solc 0.8.28's `transient`, so
 *   this needs a Cancun-capable chain. That is not a new requirement: v4's
 *   PoolManager itself is built on TSTORE, so any chain with a PoolManager to
 *   talk to has it.
