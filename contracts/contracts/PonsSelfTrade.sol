/**
 * @title PonsSelfTrade
 * @notice A Pons bonding-curve trade that CANNOT send the proceeds anywhere but
 * back to the caller. Same single idea as V4SelfSwap, applied to a second venue.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A Pons token has no Uniswap pool until it graduates at its
 * threshold — it trades only on its own bonding curve. So every route the wall
 * already grants (SwapRouter02, the v4 adapter) reaches exactly none of the
 * launchpad where essentially every new token on this chain appears. This is
 * the venue adapter for that.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST "CALL THE CURVE". The wall pins a TARGET, and buys go to a
 * PER-TOKEN curve address — a new one every launch, ~475 an hour. There is no
 * address to pin. Granting the account permission to call an arbitrary target
 * would be granting everything. So the wall pins THIS contract, the curve
 * becomes an argument, and what bounds the damage is stated honestly below
 * rather than implied.
 *
 * THE ONE INVARIANT EVERYTHING ELSE RESTS ON:
 *   assets are pulled ONLY from `msg.sender`, and paid ONLY to `msg.sender`.
 * Both are the same value, read once at entry. `msg.sender` is passed to the
 * curve's own `recipient` argument, so the curve pays the account DIRECTLY and
 * this contract is never the recipient of anything. There is no code path that
 * names a third party.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, AND WHY
 *
 * NATIVE-QUOTED CURVES ARE REFUSED. This is the big one: 53.6% of launches are
 * quoted in native ETH and none of them can be traded here. `buy()` is payable
 * and wants ETH, while every permission in the wall carries `valueLimit: 0` —
 * the account may not send native value at all. The way to bridge that is for
 * the adapter to pull WETH, unwrap it, and forward the ETH itself, and that
 * costs four of the guarantees this file otherwise inherits from V4SelfSwap:
 *
 *   1. a `receive()`, the first function in this repo that accepts ETH;
 *   2. a live ETH balance mid-transaction, so "never holds a balance" — the
 *      reason there is nothing here to steal — stops being true;
 *   3. a trust dependency on WETH, which on this chain is NOT canonical WETH9
 *      but an upgradeable TransparentUpgradeableProxy whose admin can replace
 *      the implementation, and which hands this contract FULL GAS on the
 *      withdraw payout — i.e. an upgradeable third party gets control exactly
 *      while the adapter holds ETH;
 *   4. a WETH approve permission the wall does not have today.
 *
 * That is a different contract with a different threat model, and it belongs
 * behind its own SELECTOR so the owner can grant this one without granting
 * that one — the same opt-in shape `allowRialto` and `allowUniswapV4` use. A
 * single function branching on `pairToken()` would give one permission that
 * grants both behaviours forever.
 *
 * Stated plainly so nobody discovers it later: the ERC-20-quoted curves this
 * DOES reach are 27.2% of launches, and only the USDG-quoted 2.8% are one hop
 * from the agent's cash. A stock-token-quoted curve needs USDG→NVDA first —
 * exactly as many hops as USDG→WETH→unwrap would have been. "ERC-20 is simpler"
 * is a claim about this contract, not about reach.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THREAT MODEL, HONESTLY
 *
 * - THE CURVE ARGUMENT CANNOT BE AUTHENTICATED, AND NOTHING HERE PRETENDS TO.
 *   A curve self-reports its `factory()`, which a malicious contract can return
 *   too, so checking it would be a guard that guarantees nothing. The only
 *   sound direction is factory→curve, and the Pons factory publishes no registry
 *   view (sixteen candidate selectors probed; none present in its bytecode).
 *   So a compromised session key can name an attacker's contract as `curve` and
 *   lose up to the standing allowance of an allowlisted asset.
 *
 *   That is EXACTLY the exposure the wall already carries for V4SelfSwap, whose
 *   pool key is equally caller-chosen: "a compromised session key can still swap
 *   up to the standing ERC-20 allowance into a pool the attacker owns, at a
 *   price the attacker picks". Not zero, and not new. What bounds it: `assetIn`
 *   is pinned ONE_OF the owner's own asset list by the wall, the pull is capped
 *   at `amountIn`, and `minAmountOut` is enforced HERE rather than by the curve.
 *
 * - SLIPPAGE IS ENFORCED AGAINST THE ACCOUNT'S OWN BALANCE, not against what the
 *   curve says it paid. The curve takes a `minQuoteOut`/`minTokensOut` of its
 *   own and would revert, but that is the untrusted party checking its own
 *   homework. Measuring the caller's balance before and after makes the
 *   guarantee independent of the curve being honest — the same discipline that
 *   makes V4SelfSwap take its amounts from the returned delta rather than the
 *   argument.
 *
 * - NO OWNER, NO ADMIN, NO PAUSE, NO UPGRADE, NO RESCUE. Identical trade to
 *   V4SelfSwap: an admin key able to pause the owner's exits is a worse failure
 *   than an unfixable bug in a contract with no storage and no balances. There
 *   is deliberately no sweep function, because a sweep function is a "send
 *   assets to an address" function and not having one is the point.
 *
 * - IT NEVER HOLDS A BALANCE ACROSS CALLS. The output goes from the curve to the
 *   caller without passing through here. The input does pass through — the curve
 *   pulls from its caller, which is this contract — but any residue is returned
 *   to `msg.sender` before the call ends, and the allowance is zeroed. A
 *   donation cannot subsidise anyone's trade: every path pulls its own input.
 *
 * - FEE-ON-TRANSFER TOKENS DO NOT WORK, and fail closed. The amount approved to
 *   the curve is what was pulled; a token that skims leaves the curve unable to
 *   take what it asked for, and the trade reverts.
 *
 * - A GRADUATED CURVE IS REFUSED BY NAME. Its reserves read exactly like a
 *   healthy curve's — quote side back at the virtual seed, token side empty —
 *   so without this check the failure would surface as an anonymous revert or,
 *   worse, a trade at a price for a market that has moved to Uniswap v4.
 *
 * SHAPE OF THE SIGNATURE, AND WHY IT IS FLAT. Six STATIC words, no struct and
 * no `bytes`. The wall maps args[i] to calldata offset i*32 with a flat
 * positional rule and no ABI arity check, so an all-static signature makes the
 * policy's view of the calldata and the ABI's view the same thing by
 * construction. wall.ts already carries the cautionary tale — `exactInputSingle`
 * has its recipient at word 3 while `exactInput` has it at word 2, because one
 * leading `bytes` made the tuple dynamic. Nothing here can move: no pointers
 * exist. Every word is also SEMANTIC:
 *
 *   word 0  curve         nothing useful — it is per-token and unpinnable
 *   word 1  assetIn       ONE_OF the owner's asset list
 *   word 2  assetOut      ONE_OF the same list; EQUAL USDG makes it exit-only
 *   word 3  amountIn      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL a per-trade cap
 *   word 4  minAmountOut  nothing useful — denominated in the output asset
 *   word 5  deadline      nothing useful
 *
 * DIRECTION IS DERIVED, NOT DECLARED. Whether this is a buy or a sell follows
 * from the curve's own `token()` and `pairToken()`, for the same reason
 * V4SelfSwap derives `zeroForOne` from the token order: a caller-supplied
 * direction that disagrees with the venue is a whole bug class that simply does
 * not exist if there is no such argument.
