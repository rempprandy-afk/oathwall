/**
 * @notice Uniswap v4 core, hand-written and cut to the four calls one spot swap
 * needs. There is no @uniswap/v4-core dependency in this package on purpose —
 * the house style (see IPolicy.sol) is a minimal mirrored interface, and pulling
 * v4-core in would drag Currency/BalanceDelta/PoolId user-defined value types,
 * TickMath, and a second solc pragma range into a contract that holds money.
 *
 * WHERE THE TYPES WENT. v4-core declares `type Currency is address` and
 * `type BalanceDelta is int256`. User-defined value types are erased in the ABI
 * — the canonical signature uses the UNDERLYING type — so declaring them here as
 * `address` and `int256` produces byte-identical selectors and calldata. Same for
 * `PoolId`/`bytes32`. This is checked, not assumed: the selectors below are
 * pinned in the test plan and the fork test calls the real PoolManager.
 *
 * SELECTORS (computed from these declarations, and they match v4-core):
 *   unlock(bytes)                       0x48c89491
 *   swap((address,address,uint24,int24,address),(bool,int256,uint160),bytes)
 *                                       0xf3cd914c
 *   sync(address)                       0xa5841194
 *   settle()                            0x11da60b4
 *   take(address,address,uint256)       0x0b0d9c09
 *   unlockCallback(bytes)               0x91dd7346
