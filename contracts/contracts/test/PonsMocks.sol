 * @title PonsMocks
 * @notice Test doubles for PonsSelfTrade. TEST-ONLY — never deployed anywhere.
 *
 * The real curve is a 10,229-byte contract with no published source, so this
 * reproduces only what the adapter actually depends on: the buy/sell/token/
 * pairToken/graduated surface, the fact that the curve pulls its input from ITS
 * CALLER by transferFrom, and the fact that it pays a caller-named `recipient`
 * directly. Those five behaviours were each confirmed against mainnet 4663 —
 * the selectors are present in a live curve's runtime code and a `buy` was
 * simulated through `eth_call` — and this file is not trying to be a faithful
 * bonding curve. The pricing is a fixed ratio, deliberately: what these tests
 * exist to prove is the half that is OURS.
 *
 * MockHostileCurve is the important one. The adapter cannot authenticate a
 * curve, so the security argument has to hold against a curve that lies, and
 * that argument is only worth as much as a test that actually lies.
