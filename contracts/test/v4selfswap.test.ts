/**
 * V4SelfSwap — the contract that exists so the wall can say something true
 * about a Uniswap v4 swap.
 *
 * The v4 MECHANICS it depends on (negative amountSpecified = exact input,
 * BalanceDelta packing, sqrtPriceLimit bounds, that the deployed PoolManager is
 * the release build) were verified against Robinhood Chain MAINNET during
 * design, by executing the compiled contract through eth_call state overrides
 * against the real USDG/NVDA and USDG/TSLA pools. Those facts are not
 * re-litigated here and a mock could not prove them anyway.
 *
 * What IS proved here is the half that is ours, and every claim the security
 * argument rests on: the payer is the caller, the payee is the caller, the
 * adapter keeps nothing, a standing allowance is not spendable by a third
 * party, a mis-settle is refused, an empty fill is refused, and the callback
 * cannot be driven by anyone but the PoolManager.

/**
 * The repo does not register chai-as-promised, so reverts are caught the way
 * breaker.test.ts does it. But this SIMULATES rather than sends, for a specific
 * reason: hardhat surfaces a parameterless custom error by name in the message
 * and a PARAMETERISED one (SettleMismatch(uint256,uint256)) only as "an unknown
 * RPC error". Asserting on that message would have made two of these tests pass
 * for the wrong reason and one fail while the contract was correct.
 *
 * simulateContract decodes the revert against the ABI, so the assertions can
 * name the error. "It reverted" is a much weaker claim than "it reverted with
 * NoOutput", and on this contract the difference is the whole point.
 */
/**
 * The error name, from EITHER place hardhat puts it: a decoded `data.errorName`

 *
 * Which one it uses depends on whether the error carries parameters — a
 * parameterless error decodes into the message, a parameterised one like
 * SettleMismatch(uint256,uint256) surfaces only as "an unknown RPC error".
