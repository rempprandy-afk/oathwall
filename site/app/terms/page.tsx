        <p>
          merrymen is free, open-source software published under the MIT License. This page explains
          the terms on which you use the software and this website (<strong>merrymen.dev</strong>).
          By installing or using the software, you agree to these terms. If you don&apos;t agree,
          don&apos;t use it.
        </p>

        <h2>1 · The software is provided “as is”</h2>
        <p>
          merrymen is provided under the MIT License, without warranty of any kind — express or
          implied — including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
          non-infringement. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are
          not liable for any claim, damages, loss, or other liability arising from the software or
          its use, including any loss of funds.
        </p>

        <h2>2 · Not financial advice</h2>
        <p>
          merrymen is a tool for building and running automated trading strategies. It is{" "}
          <strong>not</strong> financial, investment, legal, or tax advice, and nothing it outputs —
          including any strategy, suggestion, or agent message — is a recommendation to buy or sell
          anything. The authors are not brokers, advisers, or fiduciaries. You are solely responsible
          for your trading decisions and for complying with the laws and regulations that apply to
          you.
        </p>

        <div className="callout danger">
          <strong>Trading digital assets carries a high risk of total loss.</strong> Prices are
          volatile, smart contracts can fail, keys can be lost or stolen, and automated systems can
          behave in unexpected ways. Never trade with funds you cannot afford to lose. Start on
          testnet, then start small.
        </div>

        <h2>3 · You control your own keys and funds</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>For on-chain trading</strong>, merrymen is self-hosted and non-custodial. It runs
          on your machine, generates and stores keys locally in
          your <code className="inline">~/.merrymen</code> directory, and interacts with public blockchains directly.
          We never take custody of your private keys or on-chain funds, and we cannot access, freeze,
          reverse, or recover them. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Securing the machine merrymen runs on and backing up your keys.</li>
          <li>The permission caps and capabilities you enable, including trading, transfers, and PC control.</li>
          <li>Any transactions your configured agents submit on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Connected brokerage accounts are different, and we say so plainly.</strong> If
          merrymen adds support for a brokerage venue (such as a Robinhood Agentic account) and you
          choose to connect one: the brokerage — not merrymen — is the custodian of that account
          and its funds. Connecting authorizes merrymen to hold a revocable OAuth trading token for
          that account. That token can place trades within the budget you configured at the
          brokerage; the brokerage&apos;s permission model does not offer a read-only grant, so any
          &quot;monitor only&quot; behavior is a feature of merrymen&apos;s software, not a technical
          restriction on the token. Your brokerage login credentials are never seen or stored by
          merrymen — authorization happens on the brokerage&apos;s own pages — and you can revoke
          the connection at the brokerage at any time, independently of us.
        </p>

        <h2>4 · Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          merrymen can connect to third-party services you configure — such as blockchain RPC and
          bundler providers, Anthropic, Telegram, and transcription providers. Your use of those
          services is governed by their own terms and prices. We are not responsible for their
          availability, conduct, or fees, and API keys you provide are used only to call the services
          you point them at.
        </p>

        <h2>5 · Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          Use merrymen lawfully. Do not use it to violate any law or regulation, to infringe others&apos;
          rights, or to interfere with networks or services you are not authorized to use. The PC
          remote-control features are intended for the machine you own and operate; do not use them
          against systems you don&apos;t control.
        </p>

        <h2>6 · The website</h2>
        <p>
          This website is provided for information about the software. It may link to third-party
          sites (such as GitHub and npm) that we don&apos;t control. We may update or remove content at
          any time.
        </p>

        <h2>7 · Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms. Material changes will be reflected by the “last updated” date
          above. Continued use after a change means you accept the updated terms.
        </p>
