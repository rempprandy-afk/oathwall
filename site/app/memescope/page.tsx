            The most recent pools opened on Robinhood Chain, newest first. Launches here come fast
            enough that this is often only the last few minutes — the timestamps say exactly how far
            back the list reaches. It&apos;s the same feed a merryman watches when scouting; the
            difference is that an agent then has to get past its own guards before it can touch any
            of it.

          <h3>A new pool is not an opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            Most of what appears here is worthless, and some of it is designed to take your money —
            a pool can be opened with no real liquidity, or with a token that can&apos;t be sold once
            bought. This page reports what happened on-chain. It is not a recommendation, and nothing
            on it has been vetted.
          </p>
          <h3>Where the names come from</h3>
          <p>
            Symbols are read from each <strong>token contract</strong>, not from any index or listing
            — so what you see is what the token itself claims. That claim is written by whoever
            deployed it, which is why names are stripped to plain characters before display: it stops
            a token dressing itself up as a familiar one using invisible or right-to-left characters.
            An address that won&apos;t answer at all shows as <em>unreadable</em>, which is itself
            worth knowing.
          </p>
          <h3>What a merryman does with this</h3>
          <p>
            In <strong>scout mode</strong> an agent may take small positions in tokens it can price,
            inside a separate budget it cannot exceed, and only when it can also confirm it would be
            able to sell again. Anything it can&apos;t value is quarantined at cost rather than
            counted as profit. <Link className="link" href="/docs#safety">The safety model</Link>{" "}
            explains the wall in full, and you can{" "}
            <Link className="link" href="/watch">watch an agent trade live</Link> if you&apos;d rather
            see it than read about it.
