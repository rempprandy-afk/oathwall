              Anyone can ship a trading agent. The hard thing — the thing merrymen is — is an agent
              you don&apos;t have to trust: your owner key never leaves you, and it trades inside caps
              the chain itself enforces — a leaked session key is value-churn, never theft. Everything
              else on this page is built on top of that wall.

            <p>
              No strategist, Telegram message, or voice note ever constructs calldata, moves funds,
              or touches your PC without passing a closed, typed command set and — for money — the
              on-chain policy wall. Trades pass caps enforced by the account contract. Transfers are
              amount-capped and confirm-gated. PC actions are off by default, allowlisted, and
              confirmed. A prompt-injected “send everything to 0xevil” can at worst produce a
              confirmation card you will see and cancel.
            </p>
            <p>
              And you don&apos;t take our word for it: your dashboard shows the account contract,
              the session key, and every cap with explorer links — and a <b>prove the wall</b>{" "}
              button that fires malicious intents through the live policy so you can watch each one
              bounce.

              <p>
                A first-party agent is custodial by construction: their servers, their keys, their
                discretion — the safety story is a terms-of-service. If the platform, its model, or
                its prompt gets compromised, so does your account. You trust; it trades.

              <h4>merrymen inverts it</h4>
              <p>
                The agent holds only a session key whose limits — how much per trade, how often, how
                long it lives, and <em>where value may land</em> — are enforced by your account
                contract on-chain, verifiable in the explorer. The owner key that could lift those
                limits never leaves you. A
                compromised agent can trade inside that wall. It cannot send your funds to an
                address you never registered, and it cannot sign anything. You verify; it trades.
