            Everything a merryman owns sits in a smart account on Robinhood Chain, and a chain is
            public by construction. So you can watch yours from anywhere — no login, no account with
            us, and no server of ours between you and the answer. Paste the address and the numbers

          <h3>Where do I find the address?</h3>
          <p>
            Your own dashboard shows it at the top, and the phone app has it under{" "}
            <strong>Settings → the wall</strong>. It&apos;s the <strong>smart account</strong> — the
            one that holds the money — not the owner address your recovery phrase derives. Those are
            different addresses, and mixing them up is the single most common way people think their
            funds have vanished.
          </p>

          <h3>Why can&apos;t I see my trades and rejections here?</h3>
          <p>
            Because they aren&apos;t on the chain. A trade that <em>happened</em> is a transaction
            anyone can read — the{" "}
            <Link className="link" href="/watch">
              live tape
            </Link>{" "}
            shows those. But the reasoning behind it, and every trade your caps <em>refused</em>,
            live in your own ledger — your self-hosted dashboard, or your hosted account. This public
            page holds none of it; your own dashboard has the full picture.
          </p>

          <h3>Is this safe to open on someone else&apos;s computer?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes — an address is public information and reveals no ability to spend. Pasting one here
            lets you look; it never lets anyone move anything. Your owner key never leaves you, and
            nothing on this page asks for it.
