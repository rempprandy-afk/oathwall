"""
WHAT A MERRYMAN'S DECISION IS, as a type rather than as prose.

The contract is the whole point of this service. Upstream returns markdown from
its structured-output helper — `invoke_structured_or_freetext` validates a
Pydantic model and then throws it away in favour of `render(result)` — which
leaves the TypeScript side regex-parsing English to decide what to trade. That
is the single change that makes this a service instead of a TUI.

THREE RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES, none of them stylistic:

  1. NO ADDRESSES, EVER. Brain emits `instrument_id` and `symbol`; trusted
     TypeScript resolves those to a canonical allowlisted address. A model that
     can emit an 0x… string can emit one nobody allowlisted, and it would travel
     toward the executor. The validator below rejects the shape outright rather
     than trusting a prompt to have discouraged it.
  2. NO FLOATING-POINT MONEY. Sizes cross the service boundary as integer
     micro-USDG. A JSON float is not a quantity of money.
  3. EVERY DECISION CARRIES ITS COST. Not as telemetry bolted on afterwards —
     as a required field, so a decision that cannot say what it cost cannot be
     returned at all.
