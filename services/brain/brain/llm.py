"""
THE ONE PLACE A MODEL IS CALLED, so the one place spend can be counted.

Every node goes through `complete()`. That is not a style preference: an
accounting system with two call sites has no accounting, and the incident this
service is designed around happened because the counter did not exist anywhere.

NO SDK RETRIES. The provider clients default to retrying 2-3 times on a 429,
which silently triples the cost of a rate-limited run and hides the rate limit
from the budget. Retries here are explicit, bounded, and counted — and a retry
that would breach the ceiling does not happen.

PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC BY BASE URL rather than by a provider enum with a branch per
vendor. Groq, OpenAI, Together and most others speak the same chat-completions
shape, so one client covers them and the config says which endpoint.
