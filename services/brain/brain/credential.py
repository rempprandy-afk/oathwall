"""
BRAIN'S KEY IS ITS OWN, AND IT CANNOT BORROW THE FLEET'S.

The 24 live agents share one house key. On 2026-08-31 a background feature
nobody had switched on consumed that key's entire 200,000-token daily allowance,
and the first person to notice was a user whose chat had stopped working. Brain
evaluation is exactly that shape of workload — long, bursty, and run by someone
who is not watching the agents — so "remember not to point it at the house key"
is not a control.

The control is that the house key's NAME is refused. `GROQ_API_KEY` is what the
worker and the orchestrator read; if Brain is handed that variable, or handed a
value identical to it, it refuses to start rather than quietly spending the
fleet's allowance. An evaluation that cannot run is a bad afternoon. An
evaluation that silently stops 24 agents trading is an incident.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a claim that the two keys must be from different providers, or
even different accounts. They may be the same provider and the same billing
account — what they may not be is the same CREDENTIAL, because a shared
credential shares a rate limit and a quota, and those are the things that run
out.
