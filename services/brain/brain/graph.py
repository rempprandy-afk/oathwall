"""
HOW A MERRYMAN THINKS: analysts → debate → synthesis → risk → decision.

The topology is TradingAgents', and it is the part worth keeping — a fan-in of
independent analysts, an adversarial bull/bear pass, a synthesising manager, and
a risk committee that argues before a portfolio manager decides. Everything
around it is replaced.

WHY THIS IS NOT LANGGRAPH. The upstream graph is a LangGraph StateGraph, and
running it taught us three things that made keeping it the wrong call:

  - the final answer arrives as a STRING ("Hold"), because the structured-output
    helper validates a model and then returns `render(result)`. A service cannot
    regex prose to decide what to trade.
  - config is a module-global mutable dict and identity resolution is an
    `lru_cache`, so two concurrent analyses in one process fight over vendor
    config. A per-request service cannot have that.
  - there is no budget anywhere. 16 calls measured for a Research-shaped run,
    26 for a deep one, with nothing counting them.

Rewriting the orchestration as plain async gives exact per-node accounting, a
tier that is enforced rather than documented, and an ablation switch that is one
parameter instead of a rebuild. What we give up is LangGraph's checkpoint/resume,
which a stateless request-scoped service does not want.

EVERYTHING THE MARKET SAYS IS UNTRUSTED. Signals are scraped or vendor-supplied
text an attacker may have written, and upstream interpolates Reddit and
StockTwits bodies straight into a system message. Here they are fenced, labelled
as data, and the instruction not to obey them is adjacent to the text rather
than paragraphs away.
