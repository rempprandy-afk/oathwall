"""
THE CANONICAL SNAPSHOT, AS BRAIN RECEIVES IT — and never as Brain computes it.

`packages/core/src/portfolio-snapshot.ts` is the one implementation of what a
book is worth and whether its P&L may be published. This module is the Python
side of that wire, and its single rule is that it CARRIES those figures rather
than deriving them.

That rule is load-bearing rather than tidy. The worker computed equity from
balances, the web recomputed it from mirrored rows, and they disagreed; a third
implementation here would disagree with both, and Brain's disagreement would be
the one that reached an owner as a published thesis. So:

  - equity is read, never summed from positions;
  - P&L is read, never computed from equity minus contributions;
  - `publishable` is read, never inferred from the presence of a number.

`from_canonical` will REFUSE a payload missing any of those, because the
alternative — filling a gap with a computation — is exactly the thing this file
exists to prevent. A snapshot Brain cannot read is a refusal, not a guess.
