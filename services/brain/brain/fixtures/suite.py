"""
THE WIDER SUITE — built to answer one question the ten hand-written scenarios
cannot: WHEN DOES ESCALATING HELP?

The ten in `scenarios.py` are specific incidents, and they stay specific. This
file adds breadth along exactly the axes the escalation gate keys on, because a
gate tested only on cases that trip it tells you nothing about its false-positive
rate:

    analysts agree ←→ analysts disagree
    small bet      ←→ large relative to the book
    adding to a position ←→ opening one
    clean book     ←→ degraded quality

Every scenario carries `expect_hold`, so "the committee changed the decision" can
be scored as better or worse rather than merely counted. A change that moves a
decision away from the expected answer is a REGRESSION, and the first ablation
found two of them — the whole point of measuring rather than assuming.

The generated cases are deliberately unglamorous. Their job is to be the
denominator: if escalation only helps on dramatic setups, that is worth knowing
before it becomes the default.
