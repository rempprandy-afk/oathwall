THE THREE BOUNDARIES, tested without spending a token.

Each of these is a rule that only matters when someone is not paying attention,
which is exactly when a test is the only thing enforcing it:

  the credential boundary   Brain cannot spend the fleet's allowance
  the accounting boundary   Brain carries core's figures, never derives them
  the depth boundary        the committee runs on evidence, not by default
