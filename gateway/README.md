# Merrymen AI gateway

The holder perk, done safely: a tiny server that lets **verified $MERRYMEN holders**
run their agent's brain with **no API key and no signup** — while your upstream key
stays server-side and never ships in the (open-source) client.

## Why a gateway (and not "just ship our key")

merrymen is open source and self-hosted. Any key baked into the package is readable
by everyone who installs it — it would be scraped and abused within hours, blow your
rate limits, and get banned. So the client never holds the key. Instead:

```
holder ──GET /nonce──▶ single-use challenge ──sign──▶ /claim ──balanceOf──▶ token ──▶ paste into merrymen
merrymen ──Bearer token──▶ /v1/chat/completions ──your key──▶ upstream LLM ──▶ reply
```

- The upstream key lives only in `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_KEY` (env). Never logged, never sent to the client.
- Access tokens are **HMAC-signed and expiring** (stateless — no database).
- The claim uses a **server-issued, single-use, domain-bound nonce** (5-min TTL): the message a holder signs names the domain + a one-time nonce, so a captured signature **can't be replayed** or pre-collected, and responses carry **no wildcard CORS** so a phishing page can't read a minted token.
- Every request **re-checks the wallet's on-chain $MERRYMEN balance** (cached 10 min, bounded size), so a holder who sells loses access.
- **Per-address rate limit** on `/v1`, **per-IP rate limit** on `/nonce` + `/claim`, a hard completion clamp (`max_tokens` + `max_completion_tokens`, `n`/`best_of` pinned), and a body-size cap bound cost and abuse.
- The gateway **forces its own model** server-side — the client can't run up an expensive one and never even learns which model it is (it's branded `merrymen-fast`).

Signing is **read-only proof of control** — no transaction, no private key ever leaves the holder's wallet. Fully in keeping with merrymen's non-custodial stance.

## Discovery too: `POST /bitquery`

Same perk, same claimed token, second upstream. Set `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_BITQUERY_KEY`
and holders get Bitquery — which indexes Robinhood Chain from genesis and decodes
**Uniswap v4**, where new pairs actually launch — without a Bitquery account of
their own. Leave it unset and the route returns 503; nothing else changes.

**This route does not proxy GraphQL, and that is the whole point.** Bitquery bills
by query cost and GraphQL is unbounded by construction: one caller asking for
every event since genesis, unfiltered, is a five-figure invoice against *your*
account. `max_tokens` was enough to bound the LLM route; there is no equivalent
knob here, because the expensive part *is* the query.

So the client sends a **name**, not a query:

```bash
curl -s https://merrymen-gateway-production.up.railway.app/bitquery \
  -H "authorization: Bearer mmk_…" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"query":"recentPools","variables":{"sinceMinutes":60,"limit":25}}'
```

- The catalogue in `lib/core.mjs` (`BITQUERY_QUERIES`) **is** the attack surface.
  Every query is written there, every variable is clamped there, and a caller can
  ask for nothing that isn't in it. `GET /bitquery` lists the names.
- Adding a capability is a deliberate edit by whoever runs the gateway.
- Discovery has its **own, tighter rate bucket** (`BITQUERY_RATE_PER_MIN`, 6/min
  per wallet) — it's polled by a worker on a timer, not driven by a human typing,
  so sharing the chat allowance would let a background feed starve the brain.
- Upstream error bodies are **not** relayed; they can quote the request, and the
  request carries your key on the way out.

`node selftest.mjs` asserts all of it offline: unsigned tokens rejected, raw and
hostile queries (including `__proto__`, `constructor`) rejected by name lookup,
503 when no key is configured, and the rate bucket biting.

## Which host is live right now

**`https://merrymen-gateway-production.up.railway.app`** — this is what the client
and the website actually call, and the only host with a working certificate.

`ai.merrymen.dev` is registered on the Railway service and its DNS is correct
(CNAME to the Railway target; CAA on `merrymen.dev` permits `letsencrypt.org`),
but **TLS still fails** — the edge presents a certificate for the wrong principal,
so the Let's Encrypt issuance hasn't completed. Plain HTTP to it 301s, which
means routing is fine and only the certificate is missing. Don't point anything
at it until `curl https://ai.merrymen.dev/healthz` returns `{"ok":true}`.

When it does land, three hand-written copies of the host have to move together:

| where | constant |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core/src/token.ts` | `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_ORIGIN` — the merrymen client |
| `site/lib/gateway.ts` | `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` — the memescope page |
| `cli/bin.mjs` | the `merrymen` provider's `key` hint, shown during onboarding |

There is no shared import that could enforce that: the website doesn't compile
the TS core and the CLI is plain ESM that can't import TypeScript at all. So
`worker/src/gateway-origin.test.ts` fails the suite if the three ever disagree —
run `npm test` after changing any of them.

## Two ways to run it

The security logic lives once in `lib/core.mjs`; two thin runtimes wrap it:
`server.mjs` (a long-lived process) and `api/*.js` (Vercel serverless functions).
Point the client's host at whichever you pick.

### A) Persistent process (Railway / Fly / Render / VPS / Docker) — RECOMMENDED

```bash
cd gateway
cp .env.example .env      # fill in UPSTREAM_KEY, SECRET, RPC (+ BITQUERY_KEY for discovery)
npm install
npm run check             # offline self-test (tokens, single-use nonces, replay, /bitquery)
npm start                 # listens on :8787
```

**Railway**, concretely — `railway.json` is committed, so it builds from the
Dockerfile and health-checks `/healthz` with no dashboard fiddling:

```bash
railway init && railway up
```

Then set the variables in the Railway dashboard (**not** in the repo):
`MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_KEY`, `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_SECRET` (32+ random bytes),
`MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_RPC`, `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_BITQUERY_KEY`, and
`MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_DOMAIN` set to the host you actually serve on. Point
`ai.merrymen.dev` at the Railway service.

A single process needs no Redis — the in-memory store is correct and atomic for
one instance. **If you scale past one replica, set `KV_REST_API_URL`/`TOKEN`**,
or nonce single-use and rate limits become per-instance and stop meaning what
they say.

A `Dockerfile` (universal) and `render.yaml` (Render Blueprint) are included for a
connect-the-repo deploy. In-memory state is fine here (one process); set
`KV_REST_API_URL`/`KV_REST_API_TOKEN` only if you run multiple instances.

### B) Vercel serverless (the `ai.merrymen.dev` domain already points at Vercel)

Serverless isolates don't share memory, so the nonce/rate-limit/balance state MUST
live in a KV store — this is a hard requirement (the functions refuse to start
without it). `vercel.json` maps the clean URLs (`/nonce`, `/claim`, `/v1/…`) to the
functions in `api/`.

1. Vercel → **New Project** → import `millw14/merrymen`, set **Root Directory = `gateway`**.
2. Add a KV store: Vercel dashboard → **Storage → Upstash Redis** (or KV). It sets
   `KV_REST_API_URL` + `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` on the project automatically.
3. Add the three secrets as env vars: `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_KEY`,
   `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_SECRET` (≥32 bytes), `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_RPC` (+ optional
   `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_DOMAIN=ai.merrymen.dev`).
4. **Deploy.** Confirm against the host Vercel gives you:
   `curl https://<your-deployment>/healthz` → `{"ok":true}`. Only add
   `ai.merrymen.dev` once its certificate actually issues — see the status note
   above; today that domain fails TLS and would take the gateway down with it.

### Endpoints
- `GET /` or `/claim` — the claim page (holder connects wallet, signs, gets a token).
- `GET /nonce?address=0x…` — mint a single-use, domain-bound challenge → `{nonce, message}` (sign `message` verbatim).
- `POST /claim` — `{address, signature, nonce}` → `{token, expiresInDays}` after nonce + signature + balance checks.
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — OpenAI-compatible; `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. This is what merrymen calls.
- `GET /healthz` — liveness.

## The holder experience

1. Holder opens `https://ai.merrymen.dev/claim`, connects their wallet, signs (free).
2. Gateway checks they hold ≥ `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_MIN_TOKENS` and returns a key.
3. In merrymen → **Settings → AI provider → Merrymen AI**, they paste the key. Done — chat + the strategist now run on your dime, no third-party signup.

## Costs & limits (read before you flip it on)

You are paying for holders' inference. Protect yourself:
- Keep `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_MIN_TOKENS` meaningful, and `RATE_PER_MIN` / `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` conservative (defaults in `lib/core.mjs`).
- Groq's **free tier is per-key rate-limited** — a shared free key will throttle fast under many holders. Use a paid plan, or expect holders to queue.
- State (nonces, rate limits, balance cache) lives in `lib/store.mjs`: in-memory for a single process, or a shared KV (Upstash/Vercel KV) when `KV_REST_API_URL`/`KV_REST_API_TOKEN` are set. On serverless the KV is **required** (isolates don't share memory), so rate limits and single-use nonces hold across invocations.
- Rotating `MERRYMEN_GATEWAY_SECRET` invalidates every issued token (your kill-switch).

## Honesty note

Call the *provider* "Merrymen AI" freely — white-labeling inference is normal. Just
don't imply you trained a model; the blurb ("powers your agent's brain") stays true.
