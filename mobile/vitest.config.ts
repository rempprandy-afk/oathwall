/**
 * Vitest, for the pure logic only.
 *
 * The store and the feed types are plain TypeScript with no React Native imports,
 * so they can be tested in node without Metro, a simulator, or jest-expo — which
 * would drag in a whole RN transform pipeline to test a reducer. Anything that
 * touches a React Native module belongs in a different runner; keep this one able
 * to stay fast, because a slow test for the hot path won't get run.
 *
 * The alias is hand-written rather than read from tsconfig via a plugin: one line,
 * one fewer dependency, and it fails loudly if it ever drifts from tsconfig.json.
