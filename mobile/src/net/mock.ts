/**
 * A mock feed that behaves like the real one.
 *
 * This exists because the app has no backend yet — the dashboard's /api routes all
 * assume single-tenant local state with no auth, so there is nothing a phone can
 * point at until the hosted API lands. Rather than block the whole UI on that, the
 * store, the diffing and the lists get built and measured against this.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT random noise. To be useful for the thing it's here to
 * prove — that a live-updating list doesn't re-render rows that didn't change — it
 * has to produce realistic PARTIAL change: most rows steady, a couple ticking, a
 * new trade every few polls. Feed the store uniformly-random data and every row
 * changes every poll, which would hide exactly the bug the store is designed to
 * prevent.
 *
 * It also mimics the awkward parts of the real shape on purpose: a stale price, a
 * pool-sourced price next to chainlink ones, a rejected trade with a reject_rule,
 * and a paper fill with no tx_hash. Those are the cases that break naive UI.
