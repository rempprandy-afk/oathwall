 * mnemonic in memory, used to build the sudo validator, and dropped. What comes
 * out is a serialized SESSION account — capped on-chain, self-expiring, revocable
 * — and that is the only thing safe to hand to a server.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT mirror the dashboard's session.ts, which puts
 * `demoOwnerPrivateKey` on the grant object and POSTs the whole thing to
 * /api/grants. On a self-hosted install that is a localhost round trip to a 0600
 * file on the same machine, so it is not a leak. From a phone talking to a hosted
 * API it would upload the owner key to someone else's server, which would make the
 * product's central claim false. So the field is simply absent here.
 *
 * The policy set itself comes from packages/core so the phone and the dashboard
 * sign the IDENTICAL wall — see packages/core/src/wall.ts, pinned by
 * worker/src/wall.test.ts.
