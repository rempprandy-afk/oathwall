/**
 * Where the signed grant lives on the phone.
 *
 * SecureStore rather than AsyncStorage, because the grant carries
 * demoSessionPrivateKey — the key the worker signs trades with. It is capped and
 * expiring, so it is not the catastrophe an owner key would be, but it can still
 * spend up to the caps until it dies. That belongs in the keychain, not in a plain
 * file any process with disk access can read.
 *
 * Kept separate from keystore.ts on purpose: that file guards the OWNER key, whose
 * loss is permanent and unrecoverable. This one holds something replaceable — if
 * it goes missing the owner simply signs a new wall. Mixing them would invite
 * treating the two as equally serious, and they are not.
