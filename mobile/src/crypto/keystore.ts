import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";

/**
 * Where the owner key lives, and how we tell "gone" from "never existed".
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS AGAINST. expo-secure-store can return null for two
 * completely different situations: nothing was ever stored, or the OS destroyed
 * the key. On Android the second happens whenever biometric enrolment changes —
 * the user adds a fingerprint in system Settings — and the module CATCHES
 * KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException and returns null rather than throwing. The
 * two are indistinguishable from the read alone.
 *
 * A naive app reads null, concludes "first run", generates a fresh key, and
 * strands a funded smart account forever. So a second, DELIBERATELY
 * NON-AUTHENTICATED marker is written alongside. It survives what the key does not,
 * and the pair of them is what makes the distinction legible:
 *
 *   marker absent, secret absent  -> genuinely a first run
 *   marker PRESENT, secret absent -> the key was destroyed. Do NOT generate a new
 *                                    one. Send the owner to recovery.
 *   marker present, secret present-> normal
 *
 * ON requireAuthentication. It is deliberately OFF here, with a matching
 * keychainAccessible of WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY, and the biometric prompt
 * is applied at SIGNING time via expo-local-authentication instead. The trade is
 * explicit: `true` gives a real cryptographic gate but opts into the silent
 * destruction above on an action users take routinely; `false` survives
 * re-enrolment but the gate is enforced by our code rather than by the OS.
 * Because a verified mnemonic backup is mandatory before any key can be used,
 * destruction is recoverable either way — so the choice comes down to which
 * failure is more likely, and "user added a fingerprint" is far more likely than
 * "attacker has code execution inside the app". The sentinel is implemented
 * regardless, so flipping this to `true` later needs no other change.
