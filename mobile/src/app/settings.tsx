/**
 * Settings — and mostly, telling the truth about what this app can and cannot do.
 *
 * The hard part here is the stop button. On the dashboard the kill switch is wired
 * end to end, because the dashboard sits on the same machine as the worker. This
 * app does not. Deleting a grant from this phone's keychain removes OUR copy; it
 * does not reach an agent that is already running elsewhere with the session key,
 * and it certainly does not touch the chain.
 *
 * A "revoke" button that only clears local state while an agent keeps trading
 * would be the single most dangerous thing in the product — someone would press
 * it, believe they were safe, and walk away. So the destructive action is named
 * for what it actually does, and the section above it explains what genuinely
 * stops an agent: the expiry that is already signed into the key, or moving the
 * funds with the owner key.
 *
 * ORDERED BY THE MOMENT YOU REACH FOR IT, not by importance-in-the-abstract:
 * stop it → the secret the stopping depends on → set it up → look it up →
 * destroy it. "Stopping your agent" used to be third, below a nine-row address
 * card and a chat-setup card, which put the panic path behind two screens of
 * scrolling. Nothing in it was reworded to move it.
 *
 * Sections shrink by STATE, never behind a disclosure tap. A tap is what buries
 * safety copy: an owner who never taps never learns the limit. State-gating
 * hides only what a given user has already answered — a linked user does not
 * need the linking instructions — and every guarantee that copy carried has to
 * survive the collapse in one line, or the section does not collapse.

        WHY IT HANDS OFF RATHER THAN BEING A CHAT BOX. There is no chat endpoint:
        narrateChat lives in the worker, and everything that makes the

        executing on one message. A chat box here would reach none of that, or
        would need it all rebuilt, and a second implementation of a confirmation
        gate ends up subtly weaker than the first.

        Now THIRD, and it shrinks as you answer it. Once you are linked, the
        instructions are answered questions and the button has moved up to the
        stop section — but the confirm-park guarantee survives as one line,
